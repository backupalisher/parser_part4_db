Code;14
Display;OUT OF MEMORY XXXXX XXXXX
Description;Printer stops and PAUSE LED lights.
Causes;Not enough memory to perform the function indicated in the second line of the display. It is possible that the printer is configured for continuous label stock with the maximum label length set too long. Functions: 1. Creating a bitmap — bitmap size is larger than the label length/width specified. 2. Storing a bitmap — not enough memory available to store the bitmap created. 3. Building a format — label is too complex. 4. Storing a format — format size is too large to fit in available memory. 5. Storing a graphic — graphic image is too large to fit in the available memory. 6. Storing a font — not enough memory to store the font.
Remedy;You may do any of the following: A. STORING ERRORS - With PAUSE ON, use the -HM ZPL II command to display the amount of memory available. Then redesign the graphic/format to fit in the available memory or remove items from memory to create more space. Or Press PAUSE to skip that step in the process and continue to the next step. B. With PAUSE ON, press CANCEL and the printer skips that label formatting process and continues to the next label format. C. Turn power OFF to clear printer memory and start all over again.
Code;15
Display;
Description;Poor Print Quality.
Causes;1. Darkness set too low. 2. Incorrect media and ribbon. 3. Printhead just replaced. 4. Printhead adjustments incorrect. 5. Printhead resistance not configured to proper value.
Remedy;1. Reconfigure darkness setting. 2. Replace media and ribbon. 3. Ensure printhead is installed properly with no wires or debris caught underneath. 4. Perform required adjustments. 5. Reconfigure printhead resistance.
Code;16
Display;
Description;Truncated print, no print, or feed button operates incorrectly while using non-continuous media.
Causes;Maximum label length parameter set less than the actual label length. Printer, that is in rewind or peel-off mode, was powered on without media or backing around the rewind spindle.
