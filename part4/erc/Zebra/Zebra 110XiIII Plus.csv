Display;ERROR CONDITION OUT OF MEMORY
Description;Printer stops and PAUSE LED lights.
Causes;Not enough memory to perform the function indicated in the second line of the display. (Printer may not be configured for continuous label stock with the maximum label length set too long.) Functions: 1. Creating a bitmap size is larger than label length/ width specified. 2. Storing a bitmap: Not enough memory available to store bitmap created. 3. Building a format: Label is too complex. 4. Storing a format size too large to fit in available memory. 5. Storing a graphic image is too large to fit in available memory. 6. Storing a font: Not enough memory to store font.
Remedy;You may do any of the following: 7. Storing errors: With PAUSE on, use the -HM ZPL II command to display the amount of memory available. Redesign graphic/format to fit in available memory or remove items from memory to create more space. or 8. Press PAUSE to skip that step in the process and continue to the next step. 9. With Pause on, press CANCEL— printer skips that label formatting process and continues to the next label format. 10. Turn printer Off (O) to clear printer memory and start over.
