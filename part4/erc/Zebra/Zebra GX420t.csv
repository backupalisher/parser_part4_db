Description;The printed image does not look right.
Remedy;• The printhead is dirty. Clean the printhead. • The printhead is under temperature. • Adjust the print darkness and/or print speed. • Use the ^PR (speed) and -SD (darkness) commands referenced in the ZPL Programming Guide. • Use the D (darkness/density) and S (speed) commands in the EPL Programmer’s Guide. • Manually adjust print darkness with the six-flash sequence of Feed Button Modes on page 33. • The Windows printer driver or application software may change these settings and may require a change to optimize print quality. • The media being used is incompatible with the printer. Be sure to use the recommended media for your application, and always use Zebra-approved labels and tags. • GX Printer Models: Verify that the printer power supply in use is rated at 100 Watts of DC output. • The printhead has worn out. The printhead is a consumable item and will wear out due to friction between the media and printhead. Using unapproved media may shorten life or damage your printhead. Replace the printhead. • The platen may need cleaning or replacement. The platen (driver) roller maybe losing traction due to: • Foreign objects attached to its surface, • The rubbery smooth surface has become polished and slippery, or • There is damage to the normally smooth and flat print surface such as box knife cuts.
