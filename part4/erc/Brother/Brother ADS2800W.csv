Code;AB00
Description;The multi feeding sensor detected multiple documents.
Remedy;<User Check> • Check that the thickness of the document is within the standard. • Check that the number of documents set in each tray is within the standard. • Moisten a soft cloth with cleaning solution. Gently and evenly wipe the pick up roller and reverse roller perpendicular to the direction of the rotation with the cloth to clean it. Note: Do not use any solution except the one packaged in the accessory (ethanol or detergent on the market). Failure to keep this instruction may cause the roller deterioration or machine break down. 1 Incorrect multi feeding sensor threshold setting Reset the multi feeding sensor threshold. 2 Multi feeding sensor (Sent/ Receive) failure Replace the multi feeding sensor (Sent/ Receive). 3 Main PCB failure Replace the main PCB ASSY.
