Description;Paper feed jam Jam occurs immediately after the power is turned on. (1st tray)
Remedy;Paper path of the front unit Open the front cover check if paper is not jammed in the paper path. Remove the jammed paper. Check the sensor levers of the paper IN1 sensor and the paper IN2 sensor. Check if shape and movement of the sensor levers have any abnormality or not. Replace the sensor lever with the normal sensor lever. Check the detection condition of the sensor signal. Confirm that the sensor signals are normally detected by using the [Self-diagnostic mode] - [SWITCH SCAN] function. Replace either the CU/PU board, the front sensor board (RSG PCB) or connection cable. Check the output signal level of the paper IN1 sensor and that of the paper IN2 sensor. Check for the following signals at the FSNS connector 25 of the CU/PU board. Pin-4: Paper IN1 sensor Pin-3: Paper IN2 sensor Confirm that the above signal levels change when the sensor lever is operated. Replace the front sensor board (RSG PCB) Check the power voltages supplied to the front sensor board (RSG PCB) Check the 5V power at the FSNS connector of the front sensor board (RSF PCB). Pin-1: 5V power supply Pin-5: 0VL Replace the connection cable. Paper path of the front unit Check if paper is jammed or not in the paper path. Remove the jammed paper. Check the sensor levers of the paper IN1 sensor and the paper IN2 sensor. Check if shape and movement of the sensor levers have any abnormality or not. Replace the sensor with the normal sensor lever. Check the feed roller, pickup roller and the retard roller assembly of the tray. Check if any foreign materials such as paper dust on the surface of the feed roller or of the pickup roller or not. Remove the foreign material. Check if the feed roller or the pickup roller has worn out or not. Replace the feed roller, the pickup roller and the retard roller assembly of the tray. Paper Hopping motor Confirm that the paper hopping motor works normally by using the [Motor & Clutch Test] of the self-diagnostic mode. Replace the CU/ PU board or the paper hopping motor Paper Hopping motor driver Remove the MOTERCL connector 1 of the CU/PU board and check the following at the connector side. Several MΩ between pin-5 . FG. Several MΩ between pin-6 . FG. Several MΩ between pin-7 . FG. Several MΩ between pin-8 . FG. Replace the CU/ PU board. Paper Hopping motor drive cable Check the connection condition of the cable. Check if the connector is connected in the halfway only or not, and check if the connector is inserted in a slanted angle or not. Check also that cables are assembled without any abnormality. Replace the cable with the normal cable that normalizes the connection condition. Paper Hopping motor drive cable Check that any cable is not pinched during assembling of the apparatus. Remove the MOTERCL connector 1 of the CU/PU board and check the following at the connector side. Short circuit between pin-5 . FG Short circuit between pin-6 . FG Short circuit between pin-7 . FG Short circuit between pin-8 . FG Replace the cable with the normal cable that normalizes the connection condition Paper Hopping motor Remove the MOTERCL connector1 of the CU/ PU board and check that approx. 3.4Ω can be measured between pin-5 -pin-6 and pin-7 -pin-8 respectively at the connector side. Replace the paper hopping motor. Paper feed clutch, registration clutch Check to make sure that the paper feed clutch or registration clutch works normally by using the [Motor & Clutch Test] of the self-diagnostic mode. Open the front cover so that the rollers can be seen to check. Replace the CU/ PU board, or replace the paper feed clutch or the registration clutch. Clutch cable of paper hopping Check the connection condition of the cable. Check if the connector is connected in the halfway only or not, and check if the connector is inserted in a slanted angle or not. Check also that cables are assembled without any abnormality. Replace the cable with the normal cable that normalizes the connection condition. Paper Hopping clutch Check that any cable is not pinched during assembling of the printer. Remove the HOPLC connector 2 of the CU/PU board and check the following at the cable side. Short circuit between pin-1 . FG Remove the HOPCL connector 2 of the CU/ PU board and check that approx. 240Ω can be measured between pin-1 and pin-2. Replace the clutch and assembly it again correctly.

Description;Paper size error
Remedy;Jam occurs when paper end is located near the IN1 sensor. Multifeed of papers Open the front cover and check if multifeed of papers occurs or not. If multifeed occurs again after the jammed paper is removed, replace the retard roller of the tray in use. Paper size Does the paper size specified for printing matched with the paper size of paper set in the tray? Change the specified paper size or size of paper inside the tray. Paper IN1 sensor, paper IN2 sensor Check if shape and movement of the sensor levers is normality or not. Replace the sensor lever with the normal sensor lever.

Description;Toner cartridge cannot be recognized.
Remedy;ID unit and toner cartridge Check that the ID unit is installed in the normal position. Check that the lock lever of the toner cartridge is locked. Correct the installation to the normal installation condition. Toner sensor Is the receptor of the toner sensor dirtied? Wipe off the dirty from the toner sensor. Confirm that the toner sensor works normally by using the [SWITCH SCAN] function of the selfdiagnostic mode. Place a white paper in front of the toner sensor, and check if the SCAN state changes or not. Replace the toner sensor board or CU/ PU board or the FFC between the toner sensor board and the CU/PU board. Fuse of CU/PU board Check if the F11 is cutting or not. Replace the CU/ PU board.
