Remedy;RX PWB Clean the terminal of the following wire connectors and reconnect the connectors. If there is no continuity, replace the wire. DP TX PWB (emitter) - DP RX PWB DP RX PWB (receiver) - Control PWB(YC71) DP firmware Upgrade the control firmware and the DP firmware to the latest version. DP TX PWB DP RX PWB Replace the DP TX PWB (emitter) or the DP RX PWB (receiver). Control PWB Replace the control PWB.
Code;F000
Description;Communication error between Control PWB and Operation PWB
Causes;
Remedy;Control PWB 1 Turn the main power switch off and after 5 seconds, then turn power on. 2 Check that the wirings and connectors between the control PWB and the operation panel PWB are normal. Operation PWB and control PWB (YC12) 3 Check that the DIMM memories in the control PWB are well conducted and, if not, replace. 4 Execute U021initialize memory. 5 Replace the control PWB. Operation PWB Replace the operation PWB.
Code;F010
Description;Control PWB checksum error
Causes;Control PWB
Remedy;Turn the main power switch off/on to restart the machine. If the error is not resolved, replace control PWB and check for correct operation.
Code;F020
Description;Control PWB RAM check sum error
Causes;Main memory (RAM)
Remedy;Turn the main power switch off/on to restart the machine. If the error is not resolved, replace control PWB and check for correct operation.
