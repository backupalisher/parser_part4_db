Description;Error in Y Toner Container Reciprocation HP Sensor (PS11). Unable to detect the change in the Release Holder Shift Cam HP Sensor status (ON -> OFF) when opening the cap so that open and close status of the cap cannot be judged.
Remedy;Identify the cause of the error whether it is due to mechanical problem to open/close the cap or problem at the Release Holder Shift Cam HP Sensor side. 1. Check if the Release Holder Shift Cam HP Sensor is soiled and the installation of the sensor. 2. Drive the Hopper Unit a little with the Toner Container Removing Tool, and check the service mode (COPIER> I/O> DC-CON> P052 bit15) to see that the output value of the sensor is changed. Since it is difficult to check the screen while driving it, repeat the operation to drive it a little and check the screen until the value is changed. If it is normal, the output value of the sensor is changed when opening/closing the cap. Even if it is normal, be sure to perform step 4 and later steps. 2-1. If there is an error in drive of the Hopper Unit, check the drive system such as gears. If it is damaged, replace the Set-on Drive Unit and then perform step 4 and later steps. 2-2. When the output value of the sensor is not changed although the Hopper Unit is driven, check the Sensor Harness (to see if the harness is caught, disconnected or physically removed). If there is no problem, replace the sensor. After checking the output value in step 2, perform step 4 and later steps. 3. If the problem is not solved by replacing the foregoing parts, replace the DC controller PCB and then perform step 4 and later steps. 4. Clear the error in service mode (COPIER> FUNCTION> CLEAR> ERR), and then turn OFF and then ON the main power. 5. Replace the toner (reinstall the removed Toner Container) at least once in user mode (Adjustment/ Maintenance> Replace Specified Toner), and check that toner replacement can be performed normally.

Description;Error in Y Toner Container Reciprocation HP Sensor (PS11). Unable to detect the change in the Release Holder Shift Cam HP Sensor status (OFF -> ON) when closing the cap so that open and close status of the cap cannot be judged.
Remedy;Identify the cause of the error whether it is due to mechanical problem to open/close the cap or problem at the Release Holder Shift Cam HP Sensor side. 1. Check if the Release Holder Shift Cam HP Sensor is soiled and the installation of the sensor. 2. Drive the Hopper Unit a little with the Toner Container Removing Tool, and check the service mode (COPIER> I/O> DC-CON> P052 bit15) to see that the output value of the sensor is changed. Since it is difficult to check the screen while driving it, repeat the operation to drive it a little and check the screen until the value is changed. If it is normal, the output value of the sensor is changed when opening/closing the cap. Even if it is normal, be sure to perform step 4 and later steps. 2-1. If there is an error in drive of the Hopper Unit, check the drive system such as gears. If it is damaged, replace the Set-on Drive Unit and then perform step 4 and later steps. 2-2. When the output value of the sensor is not changed although the Hopper Unit is driven, check the Sensor Harness (to see if the harness is caught, disconnected or physically removed). If there is no problem, replace the sensor. After checking the output value in step 2, perform step 4 and later steps. 3. If the problem is not solved by replacing the foregoing parts, replace the DC controller PCB and then perform step 4 and later steps. 4. Clear the error in service mode (COPIER> FUNCTION> CLEAR> ERR), and then turn OFF and then ON the main power. 5.
