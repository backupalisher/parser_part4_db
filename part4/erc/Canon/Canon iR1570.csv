Causes;- The fixing film unit is faulty (main thermistor fault, thermal fuse blow, fixing heater fault). The power supply PCB is faulty. The DC controller PCB is faulty.
Remedy;"1. Malfunction Turn off the power; wait for 10 min, and turn on the power. Is the problem corrected? YES: End. 2. Wiring Is the wiring from the DC controller PCB to the fixing film unit normal? NO: Correct the wiring. 3. Fixing film unit Try replacing the fixing film unit. Is the problem corrected? YES: End. 4. Power supply PCB, DC controller PCB Try replacing the power supply PCB. Is the problem corrected? YES: End. NO: Replace the DC controller PCB."
Code;E100
Description;About 1.5 sec after the scanner drive signal output, the BDI* signal is not detected 3 times or more for 1.0 sec. While the laser is ON, the BD signal cycle is not as indicated for 0.5 or more continuously.
Causes;- The laser driver/BD PCB is faulty (laser activation failure, BD detection fault). The DC controller PCB is faulty. The image processor PCB is faulty.
Remedy;1. Wiring Is the wiring from the DC controller PCB to the laser scanner unit normal? NO: Correct the wiring 2. Laser scanner unit Try replacing the laser scanner unit.
