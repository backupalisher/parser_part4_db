Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Engine Controller PCB. 2) Turn OFF the power supply switch, and remove the Fixing Assembly. Measure the resistance value between the connector (FSRTH) at the Fixing Assembly side and grounding. If the resistance value is not between 368k ohm and 512k ohm (normal temperature), replace the Fixing Assembly. 3) If there is no induction between the connector (ACN) at the Fixing Assembly side and the connector (ACH) while the assembly is removed, replace the assembly. 4) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
Code;E004 0000
Description;Fixing assembly drive circuit failure
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Engine Controller PCB. 2) Check the source of power supply for the printer.
