Code;01
Description;Smudged/Streaked. There are vertical black lines or a vertical white line in a solid black image.
Causes;The vertical black lines are likely to have been caused by the ribs of the heater holder. The vertical white line is likely to have been caused by the thermal fuse (if it corresponds to the location of the fuse).
Remedy;Select heavy paper mode.
Code;02
Description;No Power. The machine at times fails to go on when its power is turned on after it has been turned off.
Causes;If the machine is tuned on immediately after it has been turned off, residual power can momentarily start up the scanner motor, causing an overload (i.e., in excess of the rating indicated for power-on).
Remedy;"If the machine fails to go on, turn off its power switch; then, turn it back on after waiting for 30 sec."
Code;03
Description;Malfunction/Faulty Detection. The machine does not permit correct placement of paper in its manual feed tray after it has delivered paper.
Causes;The machine cannot recognize insertion of paper from its manual feed tray while the main motor is on (rotating rollers) after delivery.
Remedy;Insert paper from the manual feed tray only after the main motor (roller rotation) has stopped.
Code;04
Description;Jam (Main Unit). The machine identifies a jam when it is turned off and then on with paper in its manual feed section.
Causes;The machine is designed to identify a jam if the manual feed paper sensor is on when it is tuned on, as it is not sure whether the paper is set correctly or incorrectly.
Remedy;Remove the paper, open and close the front cover, and place the paper back in the manual feed section.
