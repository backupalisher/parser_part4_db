Remedy;Identify the cause of the error whether it is due to mechanical problem to open/close the Toner Cap or problem at the Toner Container Cam HP Sensor side. 1. Check if the Toner Container Cam HP Sensor is soiled and the installation of the sensor. 2. Rotate the Set-on Drive Shaft a little with the attached tool, and check the service mode (COPIER> I/O> DCON> P024 bit5) to see that the output value of the sensor is changed. Since it is difficult to check the screen while rotating it, repeat the operation to rotate it a little and check the screen until the value is changed. If it is normal, the output value of the sensor is changed when opening/closing the Toner Cap. Even if it is normal, be sure to perform step 4 and later steps. 2-1. If there is an error in rotation of the Set-on Drive Shaft, check the drive system such as gears. If it is damaged, replace the Set-on Drive Unit and then perform step 4 and later steps. 2-2. When the Set-on Drive Unit is not driven although the Set-on Drive Shaft rotates, check if it is driven by removing the Hopper Unit. If it is not driven, replace the Hopper Unit and then perform step 4 and later steps. 2-3. When the output value of the sensor is not changed although the Set-on Drive Unit is driven, check the Sensor Harness (to see if the harness is caught, disconnected or physically removed). If there is no problem, replace the sensor. After checking the output value in step 2, perform step 4 and later steps. 3. If the problem is not solved by replacing the foregoing parts, replace the Drum Driver PCB (UN4) and then perform step 4 and later steps. 4. Clear the error in service mode (COPIER> FUNCTION> CLEAR> ERR), and then turn OFF and then ON the main power. 5. Replace the toner (reinstall the removed Toner Container) at least once in user mode (Adjustment/ Maintenance> Replace Specified Toner), and check that toner replacement can be performed normally.
