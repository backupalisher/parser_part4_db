Description;"Restart direction due to configuration change.
 The option such as the Finisher and ADF was installed or removed when all of following conditions were met and the machine configuration is changed when the main power switch is turned ON. - Settings/Registration > Preferences > Timer/Energy Settings > Quick Startup at Power-on > ON - The Main Power Switch is turned OFF - The power plug of the machine is connected to the output."
Remedy;It is recovered by turning OFF and then ON the main power. CAUTION This machine provides power to some PCBs even when in the main power OFF status. The power supply is not completely OFF by just turning OFF the main power switch and therefore, the machine is unable to detect a configuration change. When disconnecting and then connecting a connector, always disconnect the power plug. Refer to the Service Manual > Chapter 2 > External and Controls > Quick Startup for details
