Code;E000 0000
Description;Temperature rise error
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Engine Controller PCB. 2) Turn OFF the power supply switch, and remove the Fixing Assembly. Measure the resistance value between the connector (FSRTH) at the Fixing Assembly side and grounding. If the resistance value is not between 368k ohm and 512k ohm (normal temperature), replace the Fixing Assembly. 3) If the connector at the Fixing Assembly side does not have induction while the assembly is removed, replace the assembly. 4) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
Code;E001 0000
Description;High temperature error 1
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Engine Controller PCB. 2) Turn OFF the power supply switch, and remove the Fixing Assembly. Measure the resistance value between the connector (FSRTH) at the Fixing Assembly side and grounding. If the resistance value is 1k ohm or lower, replace the Fixing Assembly. 3) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
Code;E003 0000
Description;Low temperature error 1
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Engine Controller PCB. 2) Turn OFF the power supply switch, and remove the Fixing Assembly. Measure the resistance value between the connector (FSRTH) at the Fixing Assembly side and grounding. If the resistance value is not between 368k ohm and 512k ohm (normal temperature), replace the Fixing Assembly. 3) If there is no induction between the connector (ACN) at the Fixing Assembly side and the connector (ACH) while the assembly is removed, replace the assembly. 4) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
Code;E004 0000
Description;Drive circuit unit error
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Engine Controller PCB. 2) Check the source of power supply for the printer. When using the power supply from the power generator and the like, improve the source of power supply. Note: If the frequency of power supply is not the specified range (40Hz to 70Hz), the fixing temperature control is not executed normally, so this might cause the damage. 3) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
Code;E014 0000
Description;Main Motor malfunction
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Main Motor. 2) Replace the Main Motor.
Code;E100 0000
Description;Optical Unit malfunction
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Laser Scanner Unit. 2) Replace the Laser Scanner Unit
Code;E196 0000

Remedy;1) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
Code;E196 0002
Description;Main controller error
Remedy;1) Replace the Main Controller PCB.
Code;E733
Description;Engine communication error
Remedy;1) Turn OFF and then ON the power. 2) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
Code;E747 0000
Description;EEPROM error
Remedy;1) Replace the EEPROM. 2) Replace the Main Controller PCB.
Code;E805 0000
Description;Fan malfunction
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Relay PCB. 2) Replace the Main Fan.
Code;E808 0000
Description;Low voltage malfunction
Remedy;1) Reconnect the connector on the Engine Controller PCB. 2) Replace the Engine Controller PCB.
