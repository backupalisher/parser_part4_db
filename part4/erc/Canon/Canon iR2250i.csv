Developing fan (FM1): DC controller PCB (J302B) Fixing fan (FM2): DC controller PCB (J308B) Curl reducing fan (FM4): DC controller PCB (J311B) Curl reducing fan (FM5): DC controller PCB (J311B) Electrical unit fan (FM3): main controller PCB (J1028) NO: Correct the wiring and the connection. 3. Fan, DC controller PCB Try replacing the fan. Is the problem corrected? YES: End. NO: Replace the DC controller PCB.
Code;E805-0004
Description;"The clock signal is absent for 5 sec or more after the fan drive signal has been generated. The detail codes of the fans in question are as follows:
curl reducing fan (FM5)"

Code;E901-0000
Description;The motor ready signal does not arrive within 1.3 sec after the pedestal main motor drive signal is generated
Causes;The connector has poor connector. The pedestal main motor is faulty. The main power supply PCB is faulty. The pedestal controller PCB is faulty. The DC controller PCB is faulty.
Remedy;1. Connector Is the wiring between the pedestal controller PCB and the main power supply PCB and between the main power supply PCB and the DC controller PCB normal? NO: Correct the wiring. 2. Main power supply PCB Is the voltage between J206-2 (+) and J206-1 (-) on the main power supply PCB about 24 V? NO: Replace the main power supply PCB. 3. Pedestal main motor Try replacing the pedestal main motor. Is the problem corrected? YES: End. 4. Pedestal controller PCB, DC controller PCB Try replacing the pedestal controller PCB. Is the problem corrected? YES: End. NO: Replace the DC controller PCB.
