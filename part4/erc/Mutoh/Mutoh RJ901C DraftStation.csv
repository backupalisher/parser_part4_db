Display;Media cut error
Description;Even though cutting operation is performed, media is not cut off.
Remedy;"1. Does media dust accumulate in cutter groove? Remove accumulated media dust along groove. 2. Is cutter cap securely installed? Reinstall cutter cap securely. 3. Check cutter sliding up/down operation. When setting cutter, lower cutter with finger and check that cutter rises to upper end only by spring force. • When it does not rise: Refer to action in check item No. 4. • When it rises: Refer to action in check item No. 5. 4. When setting cutter after removing cutter spring, does cutter lower to lower end by its own weight? • When it lowers: Cutter spring may be defective. Replace cutter spring referring to exploded views. • When it does not lower: Cutter may be defective. Replace cutter. 5. Check if solenoid goes up/down from ""Life: Cutter"" of self-diagnosis function. a) Goes up/down: Check the position where cutter goes down to cutter groove. • OK: Cutter has reached the end of life or be damaged. Replace cutter with new one. • NG: Adjust cutter holder position. b) Does not go up/ down: Connector may be poorly connected. Check connection of following connectors. • CR board assembly: J212 • CR board assembly: J201 - J205 • Main board assembly: J110 - J114 6. CR cable may be broken, solenoid assembly may be defective, or each board assembly may be defective. a) Replace CR cable with new one. If solenoid goes up/ down, replace CR cable. b) Replace solenoid assembly with new one. (Check by connecting connectors directly) If solenoid goes up/ down, replace solenoid assembly. c) Replace CR board assembly. After replacement, adjust sensor reflection amount from ""Sen: PaperEdge AD"" of ""Test: Sensor"" of selfdiagnosis function. d) Replace main board assembly. Before replacing main board, back up parameters and recover to new main board assembly. Then start operation check."
