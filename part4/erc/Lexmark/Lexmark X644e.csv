Remedy;"1 Fuser lamp Fuser lamp AC cable Observe the lamp through the left near side of the printer. It may be necessary to remove the redrive assembly to observe the lamp turning on and off. If the lamp does not come on do the following: • If not previously removed, remove the redrive assembly. See “Redrive assembly removal”. • Remove the fuser assembly. See “Fuser assembly removal”. • Make sure the correct type of lamp is installed (voltage and wattage). • Verify that the fuser to fuser lamp cable is installed correctly to the fuser top cover assembly. If incorrect, install correctly; if correct, go to step 2. 2 AC line voltage CAUTION: When taking measurements for AC power, observe all safety precautions. Check the AC line voltage to make sure it is within operating specification. If incorrect, inform the customer; if correct, go to step 3. 3 LVPS CAUTION: When taking measurements for AC power, observe all safety precautions. Unplug the AC line cord from the printer and pull the LVPS out far enough to access CN1 on the LVPS board (see “Low voltage power supply removal”). Disconnect the LVPS to fuser AC cable, plug in the line cord, turn the printer on and measure the voltage between CN1-1 and CN1-3 on the connector (see the connector locations at “Low voltage power supply”). If incorrect, replace the LVPS assembly (see “Low voltage power supply removal”); if correct, go to step 4. 4 Fuser lamp Fuser top cover assembly Fuser connect cable (fuser to fuser lamp cable) Check continuity of the fuser to fuser AC cable, fuser top cover assembly, and fuser lamp by checking the continuity between the two pins on the fuser lamp AC cable connector: • If there is continuity, go to step 5. • If there is no continuity, check the continuity of the fuser to fuser lamp AC cable. If incorrect, replace the lamp, if incorrect, replace the fuser top cover assembly. Note: If the fuser lamp is replaced, allow the fuser assembly to cool or a 925.xx error may be displayed. 5 LVPS LVPS to fuser AC cable CAUTION: When taking measurements for AC power, observe all safety precautions. Check the AC line voltage between the pins on the fuser end of the LPVS to fuser AC cable. If the voltage is correct, unplug the AC power cord from the LVPS cable. If the voltage is correct, unplug the AC power cord from the LVPS, pull the LVPS out far enough to be able to check the voltage between CN-1 and CN1-3 on the LVPS board. Plug in the power cord, turn the printer on and check the voltage. If correct, replace the LVPS to fuser AC cable; if incorrect, replace the LVPS assembly. Note: If the fuses in the LVPS are blown, the LVPS assembly must be replaced. 6 Fuser top cover assembly (thermistor, thermistor cable) Fuser to system board DC cable Check to make sure that the thermistor is installed correctly to J5 on the fuser control card. If installed correctly check the cable for any signs of damage. If any problems are found, replace the fuser top cover assembly. If no problem is found, check the fuser to system board DC cable for correct installation at J1 on the fuser control card. If no problem is found, check the fuser to system board cable for correct installation at J10 on the system board. 7 Error code 920.06 displayed LVPS System board System board to LVPS cable Carefully check the installation of the LVPS to system board cable to J27 on the system board and to CN2 on the LVPS. If the cable is not seated or installed properly, reseat the cable and retry the printer. If the cable is installed correctly, replace the following FRUs in the order shown: • LVPS assembly. See “Low voltage power supply removal”. • System board assembly. See “System board and inner shield removal —models X644e/X646e”. • LVPS to system board cable. 8 Fuser assembly If no problem is found up to this point, then replace the following in the order shown: • Fuser assembly.

Disconnect the AC line cord from the printer. Disconnect the LVPS to fuser cable from the fuser to fuser lamp cable. Plug the AC line cord into the printer and check the AC line voltage between the pins on the fuser end of the LVPS to fuser AC cable. If the voltage is correct, unplug the AC power cord from the LVPS cable and pull the LVPS out far enough to be able to check the voltage between CN-1 and CN-3 on the LVPS board. Plug in the power cord, turn the printer on and check the voltage. If correct, replace the LVPS to fuser AC cable; if incorrect, replace the LVPS assembly. See “Low voltage power supply removal”. Note: If the fuses in the LVPS are blown, the LVPS assembly must be replaced. 5 Fuser top cover assembly (thermistor, thermistor cable) Fuser to system board DC cable Check to make sure that the thermistor is installed correctly to J5 on the fuser control card. If installed correctly check the cable for any signs of damage. If any problems are found, replace the fuser top cover assembly.“Fuser narrow media sensor removal”. If no problem is found, check the fuser to system board DC cable for correct installation at J1 on the fuser control card. If no problem is found, check the fuser to system board cable for correct installation at J10 on the system board. If no problem is found, go to step 6. 6 Fuser assembly If no problem is found up to this point, then replace the following in the order shown: • Fuser assembly. See “Fuser assembly removal”. • System board assembly. See “System board and inner shield removal —models X644e/X646e”. • LVPS. See “Low voltage power supply removal”."

Description;Fuser over temperature. • Short in the thermistor circuit. • Noisy thermistor signal • Fuser is actually overheating due to hardware faults.
Remedy;"1 Fuser assembly Check for any signs of overheating in the fuser assembly. Check the hot roll, hot roll bearings, and the area around the thermistor for any signs of excessive heat. If a problem is found, replace the thermistor. If no problem is found, go to step 2. 2 Fuser top cover assembly (thermistor) Turn the printer off and disconnect the fuser to system board cable from J10 on the system board. Check the resistance between pins J10-3 and J10-4. The resistance should be greater than 100K ohms. If correct, go to step 3; if incorrect, disconnect the thermistor cable from J5 on the fuser board and measure the resistance between the two pins on the thermistor cable. If incorrect, replace the fuser top cover assembly (see “Fuser narrow media sensor removal”); if correct, replace the fuser to system board cable. 3 System board Fuser top cover assembly Check the voltage on J10-3 ground on the system board. The voltage should measure approximately +3.3 V dc. If the voltage is correct, replace the fuser top cover assembly. See “Fuser narrow media sensor removal”. If incorrect, replace the system board. See “System board and inner shield removal —models X644e/X646e”."

Remedy;1 Fuser assembly Fuser to system board cable Check the thermistor cable for correct installation to J5 on the fuser card. If installed correctly, check for correct installation of J10 on the system board. If all cables are installed correctly, go to step 2. 2 Fuser top cover assembly (thermistor/thermistor cable assembly) Turn the printer off and disconnect the thermistor cable from J5 on the fuser board. Measure the resistance between the two pins on the thermistor cable, if the resistance measures infinity (open circuit), replace the fuser top cover assembly. 3 Fuser to system board cable. System board Fuser assembly Reconnect the thermistor cable to J5 on the fuser board.
