If error clears, problem solved, otherwise turn printer off and replace engine controller board. See “Engine controller board removal”.
Code;SVC N4
Description;Toner empty sensor error 1
Causes;Improper connection between engine controller board and toner sensor sender board.
Remedy;1 Turn printer off and remove engine controller board board shield. See “Engine controller board removal” for steps to remove engine controller board shield. Is cable properly connected to engine controller board connector MCN8? Go to step 2. Properly connect cable. Retest printer. If error clears, problem solved, otherwise go to step 2. 2 Check the following for continuity between engine controller board MCN8 cable and toner empty sensor (sender-TPD) cable. See “Toner sensor (sender) removal” for steps to gain access to sensor cable. MCN8 Toner empty sensor sender pin 1 pin 1 pin 3 pin 2 pin 5 pin 3 Also check for shorted pins. Is cable okay? Go to step 3. Replace cable. Retest printer. If error clears, problem solved, otherwise go to step 3. 3 Replace toner empty sensor (sender-TPD). See “Toner sensor (sender) removal” for steps. Retest printer. Does error clear? Problem solved. Go to step 4. 4 Replace engine controller board. See “Engine controller board removal”. POR printer. Does error clear? Problem solved.
