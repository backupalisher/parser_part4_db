Code;01
Display;Bypass Jam
Description;Paper was sensed at the manual bypass sensor, but not at the main paper feed/toner cartridge present sensor.
Remedy;• Load paper in the manual bypass or remove the jam from the manual bypass. • Make sure the main paper feed/toner cartridge present sensor actuator is not broken, improperly installed or stuck with paper debris. • Perform the “Sensor test” to check proper operation of the sensor. • If the sensor works properly, the problem is likely associated with the system board. • If the paper path and sensor actuator are clear and working properly, and the problem persists, replace the HVPS/ LVPS. Note: This sensor is a component of the HVPS/LVPS.
Code;02
Display;Document Jam
Description;Paper was sensed at the ADF registration sensor, but not at the ADF scan sensor.
Remedy;• Make sure the ADF scan sensor actuator is not broken, improperly installed or stuck with paper debris. • If the paper path and sensor actuator are clear and working properly, replace the scanner assembly.
Code;03
Display;Door Open
Description;Front or rear cover is not securely latched.
Remedy;• Close the front toner cartridge access cover until it locks. • If the message does not clear, perform the “Sensor test” to check proper operation of the switch. • If the switch works properly, the problem is likely associated with the system board. • If the switch does not work in the test, make sure the cover open actuator is working properly. When the cover closes, the cover should push the actuator, causing the cover open switch on the HVPS/LVPS to close. Note: This process is viewable with the right cover removed. • If all moving parts appear to be working correctly, and the messages does not clear, replace the HVPS/LVPS.
Code;04
Display;Fuser Error
Description;Problem in the fuser unit.
Remedy;• Make sure CN1 and CN7 on the HVPS/ LVPS are properly connected. • Check CN1 on the HVPS/LVPS for proper voltage. • If the voltage is correct, replace the fuser. • Otherwise, replace the HVPS/LVPS.
Code;05
Display;Load Bypass
Description;No document loaded in the manual bypass.
Remedy;Load print media into the manual bypass and try again.
Code;06
Display;LSU Error
Description;A problem in the LSU (laser scanning unit).
Remedy;• Make sure all cables are properly connected to the printhead. • If correct, replace the printhead.
Code;07
Display;Memory Full
Description;Collated copy is too large for memory.
Remedy;Reduce the number of pages in the job.
Code;08
Display;No Cartridge
Description;Toner cartridge not installed.
Remedy;Install the toner cartridge.
Code;09
Display;No Paper
Description;No paper in the paper tray.
Remedy;• If paper exists in the paper tray but this message is displayed, make sure the paper empty sensor actuator is not broken or improperly installed. • If the actuator is working properly, replace the HVPS/ LVPS.
Code;10
Display;Open Heat Error
Description;The printer senses that the thermistor isn’t connected or faulty.
Remedy;• Make sure the thermistor is properly connected to CN7 on the HVPS/LVPS. • If the problem persists replace the fuser.
Code;11
Display;Overheat
Description;The fuser unit has overheated.
Remedy;Replace the fuser.
Code;12
Display;Paper Jam 0
Description;Paper was sensed at the paper tray empty sensor, but not at the manual bypass.
Remedy;• Go to the paper path diagram “Printer engine paper path/ paper jams” to see the region where a paper jam may occur. • Remove any obstructions and other paper debris. • Make sure the manual bypass sensor actuator is not broken, improperly installed or stuck with paper debris. • Perform the “Sensor test” to check proper operation of the sensor. • If the sensor works properly, the problem is likely associated with the system board. • If the paper path and sensor actuator are clear and working properly, and the problem persists, replace the HVPS/ LVPS. Note: This sensor is a component of the HVPS/LVPS.
Code;13
Display;Paper Jam 1
Description;The fuser exit sensor sensed the leading edge of the page but never sensed the trailing edge.
Remedy;• Go to the paper path diagram “Printer engine paper path/ paper jams” to see the region where a paper jam may occur. • Remove any obstructions and other paper debris. • Perform the “Sensor test” to check proper operation of the sensor. • If the sensor works properly, the problem is likely associated with the system board. • Make sure the fuser exit sensor isn’t stuck with debris or improperly installed. • If the paper path and sensor actuator are clear and working properly, replace the HVPS/LVPS. Note: This sensor is a component of the HVPS/LVPS.
Code;14
Display;Paper Jam 2
Description;Paper was sensed at the main paper feed/ toner cartridge present sensor, but not at the fuser exit sensor.
Remedy;• Go to the paper path diagram “Printer engine paper path/ paper jams” to see the region where a paper jam may occur. • Remove any obstructions and other paper debris. • Perform the “Sensor test” to check proper operation of the sensor. • If the sensor works properly, the problem is likely associated with the system board. • Make sure the fuser exit sensor actuator is not broken, improperly installed or stuck with paper debris. • If the paper path and sensor actuator are clear and working properly, and the problem persists, replace the HVPS/ LVPS. Note: This sensor is a component of the HVPS/LVPS.
Code;15
Display;Power Failure
Description;Power interruption and the machine’s memory is not saved.
Remedy;Restart the print job.
Code;16
Display;Time/Date prompt
Description;Prompt appears when the machine is powered on.
Remedy;• Use the numeric keypad to enter the two-digit month and day, and the fourdigit year. For example, 01-23- 2003. • Enter the current time. The default clock setting is 12- hour. • Press the asterisk (*) to select AM or PM, and then press Select. Note: If the machine is unplugged for longer than 15 minutes, or turned off for longer than an hour, when the power is turned back on, the machine prompts you to reset the correct date and time.
Code;17
Display;Toner Empty
Description;Toner cartridge has run out.
Remedy;Install a new toner cartridge.
Code;18
Display;Toner Low
Description;Toner is nearly empty.
Remedy;Remove the toner cartridge and gently shake it. This temporarily reestablishes printing.
