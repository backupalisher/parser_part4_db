Code;900
Description;RIP Software
Causes;Unrecoverable RIP software error. May be the result of a code malfunction, or failure of the RIP controller board.
Code;901
Description;Engine Flash
Causes;An attempt was made to program the flash memory on the engine board, and the programming failed. Replace the engine board.
Code;920
Description;Fuser Error
Causes;A problem with the fuser. Confirm that the fuser was installed correctly and that all connections are made. If installation is correct, replace the fuser.
Code;927
Description;Fan Stalled
Causes;The cooling fan has stopped when it should be running. Check the connection of the fan to the LVPS. If connections are correct, check the LVPS for proper operating voltage of the fan as described in the Wiring Diagram section of this manual. If voltage check is incorrect, replace the LVPS. Otherwise, replace the fan.
Code;930
Description;Printhead Error
Causes;The printer has detected a printhead motor abnormality. Check the connection of the printhead cable to the printhead and engine board. If connections are correct, check the engine board for proper operating voltage of the printhead scanner motor as described in the Wiring Diagram section of this manual. If voltage is incorrect, replace the engine board. Otherwise, replace the printhead.
Code;939
Description;RIP-Engine Comm
Causes;The engine board has not responded correctly to a command from the RIP board after several tries. Check the connection between the engine and RIP boards. If connection is good, replace the engine board. If problem persists, replace the RIP board.
Code;952
Description;Engine Error
Causes;An engine board NVM abnormality. Replace the engine board.
Code;953
Description;NVRAM Failure
Causes;A failure detected with the NVRAM chip on the RIP board. Replace the RIP board.
Code;954
Description;NVRAM failure
Causes;A failure detected with the NVRAM CRC on the RIP board. Replace the RIP board.
Code;955
Description;Code CRC
Causes;The code ROM or NAND failed the CRC check or the NAND experienced an uncorrectable multi-bit failure. Replace the RIP board.
Code;956
Description;System Board
Causes;A processor failure on the RIP board. Replace the RIP board.
Code;957
Description;System Board
Causes;A ASIC failure on the RIP board. Replace the RIP board.
Code;958
Description;NAND Failure
Causes;"The printer has performed more than 100 ""shift and re-flash"" operations as a result of Error Correction Code bit corrections. It is an indication that the NAND on the RIP board is failing. Replace the RIP board."
Code;959
Description;NAND Failure
Causes;A SRAM failure on the RIP board. Replace the RIP board.
Code;960
Description;Memory Error
Causes;The RAM soldered on the RIP board is bad. Replace the RIP board.
Code;961
Description;Memory Error
Causes;The RAM in slot 1 on the RIP board is bad. Replace the failing RAM card.
Code;962
Description;Memory Error
Causes;The RAM in slot 2 on the RIP board is bad. Replace the failing RAM card.
Code;964
Description;Emulation Error
Causes;"A failure within the download emulation CRC which is programmed into the RIP board. To resolve the problem, a servicer may disable the download emulation by entering the Configuration Menu and set the Download Emulation to ""Disabled."" The download emulation may be reinstalled at that point. If the problem persists, the download emulator may be faulty and should be replaced."
Code;975
Description;Network Card
Causes;The network port is unrecognizable. For printers equipped with (standard) network circuitry on the RIP board, replace the RIP board. For printers equipped with an optional network card, replace the failing card.
Code;976
Description;Network Card
Causes;An unrecoverable software error in the network port. For printers equipped with (standard) network circuitry on the RIP board, replace the RIP board. For printers equipped with an optional network card, replace the failing card.
Code;978
Description;Network Card
Causes;A bad checksum while programming the network port. For printers equipped with (standard) network circuitry on the RIP board, replace the RIP board. For printers equipped with an optional network card, replace the failing card.
Code;979
Description;Network Card
Causes;Flash parts failed while programming the network port. For printers equipped with (standard) network circuitry on the RIP board, replace the RIP board. For printers equipped with an optional network card, replace the failing card.
Code;980
Description;Duplex Comm.
Causes;A communication error occurred between the base printer and the optional duplex unit. Check the installation of the duplex unit, particularly the electrical connection. If installed correctly, remove the duplex unit to see if the error message goes away after rebooting. If the problem goes away, replace the duplex unit. If the problem persists, replace the RIP board.
