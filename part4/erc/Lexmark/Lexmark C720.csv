Description;OPC Belt Cartridge Belt Marker Sensor (PBS) Error This error indicates a problem with the OPC belt cartridge belt marker sensor (PBS).
Remedy;1 Belt Cartridge (OPC) Ensure the printer is level. If the belt sensor (PBS) is stained, clean the belt marker sensor. Replace the OPC belt cartridge if it is damaged or leaning to one side. 2 Check Connector Ensure a proper connection between DCN16 on the IOD1 P.W.B. board and the belt marker sensor (PBS). Ensure a proper connection between DCN1 on the IOD1 P.W.B. board and 11CN on the main engine (MCTL P.W.B.) board. 3 Belt Marker Sensor (PBS) Check for +5V between DCN16-2 and DCN16-3 on the IOD1 P.W.B. board. If the voltage is +5V, replace the belt marker sensor. Check for +5V between DCN2-1 and DCN2-4 on the IOD1 P.W.B. board. If the voltage is +5V, replace the IOD1 P.W.B. board. 4 Main Engine (MCTL P.W.B.) Board If the problem still exists, replace the main engine (MCTL P.W.B.) board.
Code;997
Description;Charger HV Unit (HVU) Error This error indicates a problem with the high voltage power supply unit (HVU).
Remedy;1 OPC Belt Cartridge Ensure the charge unit, on the belt cartridge, is installed correctly. Check the charge corona wire for a cut or short. Replace the OPC belt cartridge, if necessary. Note: This is a customer orderable part. 2 High Voltage Power Supply (HVU) Turn the printer Off and unplug the power cord. Ensure proper contact between the high voltage power supply and all CHV output and contact terminals on the high voltage power supply (HVU).
