Check for: • Correct type of paper • Curled or wrinkled paper • Paper path obstructions • Paper pick roller wear or looseness. If the paper pick rollers are defective, then replace the print engine. See “Print engine assembly removal” on page-39. • Worn gears or binds. If the gears are defective, then replace the print engine. See “Print engine assembly removal”. Blurred prints and voids can be caused by problems in the carrier transport area. Check for: • Carrier transport belt and idler pulley parts for wear, damage, or looseness. If the carrier transport belt is worn or if the idler pulley parts are defective, then replace the print engine. See “Print engine assembly removal”. • Carrier shaft for wear or dirt. If the rod is dirty, then clean and lubricate it. The carrier to carrier frame engagement should be lubricated with grease P/N 40X0179.
