Remedy;Note: Do not adjust or replace any printhead before performing checks in “Printhead diagnostics”. If you get a printhead error, follow this diagnostic to find the specific failure. 1. Verify all the printhead cables are properly seated. If the printhead cables are properly seated and the error remains, record the error code. Continue to the next step. 2. Determine how to setup the printhead diagnostic tool. a. Verify the printhead diagnostic tool is configured as in the illustration below. Reconfigure if necessary. b. Select which pair of printheads to use based on the error code. If the printer displays the codes that indicate yellow or cyan, use the tool to switch the yellow and cyan signals. If the error codes indicated a magenta or black error, use the tool to switch the magenta and black signals. 3. Install the printhead diagnostic tool and determine the problem. The following procedure shows the yellow and cyan switch as an example. a. Turn off the printer. b. Unplug the printhead cables from the system board in the printer and connect them to the printhead diagnostic tool. c. Connect the printhead diagnostic tool cables to the connectors on the system board in the printer. This reverses the printhead color signals for the selected pair of colors. d. Turn on the printer and note the new error codes. • If an automatic calibration begins, 36 Printer Service Required may appear. The printhead and system board are working correctly and the printhead cable connections should be checked. Press Go to clear the error. • If the error code remains the same, replace the system board. If that solves the problem, you are finished. • If the printer displays a different printhead error code, which indicates another color, the printhead or the printhead cables are defective. See the table below for the printhead codes. For example, the printer originally displays the printhead error code 108 (yellow). After switching the signals using the diagnostic tool, the printer displays the printhead error code 106 (cyan). 4. Remove the printhead diagnostic tool. 5. The problem is in either the printhead cables or the printhead. Replace the printhead cables. If the problem persists, replace the printhead. See “Printhead removal and adjustments”. Note: Replace and adjust only one printhead at a time.
