Description;Scanner Jam Remove Originals
Remedy;Paper in the ADF is covering the paper present sensor. ADF ADF card Controller card ADF pick pad ADF separator roller ADF paper tray and extender. ADF cover Ensure that the proper paper size is being used in the ADF. Are the paper guides on the ADF tray properly adjusted? Inspect the ADF separator roll and ADF separator pad for wear. If they are worn, replace them. If excessive jamming occurs at the white mylar sheet located at the bottom of the ADF unit, replace the ADF unit. Inspect the paper present and paper position sensors on the ADF. • Check for dirt in the sensors. Clean if needed. • Check the flags on the sensor. Are they able to move freely? If the sensor flags are damaged, replace the sensor assembly. If the sensor flags are ok, check to see if they are properly connected to the ADF card (located in the ADF). Replace sensor assembly if needed. Make sure the ADF cable is securely connected to the ADF card and the controller card. If the cable is properly connected, perform the following checks: • Check the ADF cable for continuity. • Check pin 15 on controller card connector J3 for +5V. • Check pin 19 on controller card connector J3for +24V. • Pins 6,14,17,18,20,and 22 should be ground. If voltages are present, replace the ADF card. If that does not fix the problem, replace the ADF. If replacing the ADF does not fix the problem, replace the controller card. If the ADF is multi feeding, check the ADF pick roller and pad for dirt. Remove them from the MFP, and clean them with a lint free cloth and isopropyl alcohol. If the leading edge of the paper is damaged, instruct the user to lessen the number of documents being copied from the ADF at one time. If thin, glossy paper, or carbon forms are used in the ADF, use the high friction pick pad (40X3499). If there are excessive misfeeds from the ADF, verify the the ADF paper tray and extender are properly installed. Skews and jams at the ADF paper present sensor might be caused by an improperly closed ADF cover. Ensure the ADF cover is closed properly.

Description;Fuser Error Indicates that the fuser is below temperature when printing.
Remedy;Lamp cable LVPS/HVPS Fuser Unplug the MFP and disconnect the fuser lamp cable plug from the LVPS/HVPS board connector CN102. Check for continuity across the fuser lamp by checking across the connector pins. • If there is continuity, go to Step 1: Continuity. • If there is no continuity, go to Step 2: No continuity. Step 1: Continuity Turn the MFP on with only the fuser power disconnected. Measure the voltage at connector CN102 on the LVPS/HVPS. It should match the line voltage. If line voltage is not present, see “LVPS/HVPS service check” for more information. Make sure the fuser thermistor is correctly connected to the controller board. If the problem persists, disconnect the thermistor cable at J15 and check for less than +5 V dc on pin 1. Pin 2 should be ground. If line voltage is incorrect on pin 1, see “Controller card service check” for more information. Step 2: No continuity Check the lamp cable for continuity. • If correct, replace the fuser. • If incorrect, replace the lamp cable. Disconnect the thermistor cable from J15 on the controller card. Measure the resistance across the ends of the thermistor cable. See “Controller card” for more information. Replace the fuser assembly if the resistance is lower than 1K ohm or shorted.
