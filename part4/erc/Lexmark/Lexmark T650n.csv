Description;"Res Save Off Deficient Memory This IR is displayed when the printer lacks sufficient memory to enable Resource Save. This message usually indicates the user has allocated too much memory for one or more of the printer`s link buffers; however, modification of other printer settings which affect the amount of available memory may also create this condition. If the user desires to enable Resource Save after this message has been posted, it is recommended the user either install additional memory or set each link buffer back to the Auto value. Once all link buffers are returned to Auto, the user should exit the menus to activate the link buffer changes. Once the printer returns to the Ready state, the user may then enable Resource Save and then finally go back and modify the link buffers again. The user should note the reduction of available memory to the link buffers when Resource Save has been enabled as opposed to the memory available when Resource Save is disabled."
Remedy;"This message displays when the printer lacks sufficient memory to enable Resource Save. This message usually indicates the user has allocated too much memory for one or more of the printer link buffers; however, modification of other printer settings which affect the amount of available memory may also create this condition. If restoration of Resource Save is required after this message is received, the customer should install additional memory or set each link buffer to Auto. Once all link buffers are returned to Auto, you should exit the menu to activate the link buffer changes. Once the printer returns to the Ready state, you can enable Resource Save and go back and modify the link buffers again. Note the reduction of available memory to the link buffers when Resource Save has been enabled, and compare it to the memory available when Resource Save is disabled. • Press to disable Resource Save and continue printing. To enable Resource Save after you get this message: - Make sure the link buffers are set to Auto, then exit the menus to activate the link buffer changes. - When Ready is displayed, enable Resource Save. • Install additional memory."
