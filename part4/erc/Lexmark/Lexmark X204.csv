Remedy;ADF ADF cable Controller card ADF pick pad ADF separator roller ADF paper tray and extender. ADF cover Ensure that the proper paper size is being used in the ADF. Are the paper guides on the ADF tray properly adjusted? Inspect the ADF separator roll and ADF separator pad for wear. If they are worn, replace them. If they are dirty or have a buildup on them, clean them with a damp cloth. If the ADF fails to pick check to make sure that the paper height in the ADF input tray is beneath the height marker on the ADF paper guides. Inspect the paper present sensor on the ADF. • Perform the paper present and scan first sensor tests. See “Sensor Test” • Check the flags on the sensor. Are they able to move freely? If the sensor flags are damaged, replace the ADF assembly. Make sure the ADF cable is securely connected to the ADF and the controller card. If the cable is properly connected, perform the following checks: • Check the ADF cable for continuity. • Check pin 1 on controller card connector J2 for +5V. • Pin 3 should be ground. If voltages are present, replace the ADF. If replacing the ADF does not fix the problem, replace the controller card. If the ADF is multi feeding, check the ADF pick roller and pad for dirt. Remove them from the MFP, and clean them with a lint free cloth and isopropyl alcohol. If the leading edge of the paper is damaged, instruct the user to lessen the number of documents being copied from the ADF at one time. If there are excessive misfeeds from the ADF, verify the the ADF paper tray and extender are properly installed. Skews and jams at the ADF paper present sensor might be caused by an improperly closed ADF cover. Ensure the ADF cover is closed properly.

Remedy;Replace the controller board. Controller card assembly Verify +24 V dc input from the LVPS/HVPS. • Turn the MFP off. • Disconnect the LVPS/HVPS cable from the controller card at J22. See “Controller card” for more information. • Turn the MFP on. Verify +24 V dc from the cable connector of J22, pins 8 and 9. Verify that pins 7, 12, and 14 on both the cable and the card connectors are ground. • If voltage is correct, check the continuity in the cable. If the cable is good, see the “Controller card” for more information. • If grounds are not correct on the cable, first check it for continuity and then check the LVPS/HVPS. See “LVPS/HVPS service check” • If the grounds are not correct on the controller card, replace the controller card. (Check with one probe on the connector pin and the other on the ground plane of the card found at each screw head.) Note: With all cables connected, the MFP should complete POST within approximately 12–15 seconds in the following sequence: 1. The function and scan quality LEDs illuminate for one second and then flash three times. 2. Loading is displayed on the operator panel. 3. The CIS illuminates, and the scanner performs a calibration. 4. The drive motor runs. 5. The scanner CIS returns to the home position. 6. Error messages are displayed if applicable. 7. The MFP cycles down into standby mode/ready. Ready is displayed on the operator panel. If immediately following power-on, the operator panel lights are active but the MFP does not go through steps 1 and 2 above, replace the controller card assembly.
