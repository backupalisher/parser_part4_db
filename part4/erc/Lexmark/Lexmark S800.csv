Description;Carrier Jam The carrier is jammed and will not move.
Remedy;• The carrier slams against the side frame. • There is no carrier movement. • Check the encoder strip for proper installation or contamination. Clean as possible. • Check the carrier cable connectors on the system board. If connectors are okay, then replace the system board. See “System board with media sensor, cable, and spring removal”. If that does not fix the problem, then replace the print engine. See “Print engine removal”. Poor print quality Be sure that the All-In-One contains good print tanks. Be sure the print tank nozzle plate is clean. Clean with a soft cloth. Ink smudging and smearing can be caused by paper problems or problems in the paper feed area. Check for: • Correct type of paper • Curled or wrinkled paper • Paper path obstructions • Feed roller wear or looseness • Worn gears or binds If the paper feed roller or gears are defective, then replace the All-In-One. Blurred print and voids can be caused by problems in the carrier transport area. Check the following: • Carrier transport belt for wear • Idler pulley parts for wear, damage, or looseness • Carrier guide rod for wear or dirt. If the rod is dirty, then clean and lubricate it. The carrier to carrier frame engagement should be lubricated with grease P/N 40X0179. If the carrier transport belt is worn, then replace the print engine. See “Print engine removal”. If the idler pulley parts are defective, then replace the print engine. See “Print engine removal”.
