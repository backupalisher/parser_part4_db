Description;Service Code CRC <loc>
Remedy;The Code ROM or NAND flash failed the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) check or the NAND experienced an uncorrectible multi-bit failure. “<loc>” indicates the source of the failure and has one of the following values: • CRC Failure: The source is a failing package indicated by Pn where “n” is the package number. This error could occur on a controller with ROM or NAND flash and could occur as a result of the CRC check done when the machine is powered on. The range of package numbers is from 0 to 15. • Error Correction Code (ECC) Failure: The source is a failing page indicated by Bn where “n” is the page number. This error occurs only if a multi-bit failure is detected during the ECC execution. Single bit failures will be corrected automatically and will not result in a service error. The range of page numbers is from 0 to 1023.
