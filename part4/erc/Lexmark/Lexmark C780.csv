Description;106.xx Printhead Error Cyan printhead error. 107.xx Printhead Error Magenta printhead error 108.xx Printhead Error Yellow printhead error 109.xx Printhead Error Black printhead error
Remedy;If you get a printhead error, follow this diagnostic to find the specific failure. 1. Remove the top cover. See “Top cover assembly removal”. 2. Remove the outer system board shield. See “Outer system board shield removal”. 3. Verify that all the connectors are properly seated. Check the printhead cable connectors on the printheads as well as the printhead cable connectors and mirror motor cable connectors on the system board. If the printhead and mirror motor cables are properly seated and the error remains, record the error code. Continue to the next step. 4. Select which pair of printheads to switch based on the error code. • If the printer displays one of the codes that indicate yellow or cyan, switch the yellow with the cyan printhead cable and the yellow with the cyan mirror motor cable. • If the error code indicates a magenta or a black error, switch the magenta with the black printhead cable and the magenta with the black mirror motor cable. 5. Turn on the printer and compare the new error codes with the original error code you recorded. Note: If an automatic calibration begins, 36 Printer Service Required may appear. Check the printhead cable connections. Press to clear the error. • If the error code remains the same, replace the system board. See “System board removal”. If that solves the problem, you are finished. Make sure you return all the cables to the original positions. • If the printer displays a different printhead error code, which indicates the code for the other color of the pair you switched, the printhead or the printhead cables are defective. Return all the cables to the original positions. Replace the printhead cables. If the problem remains, replace the printhead. See “Printhead removal and adjustments”.

Description;TMC Error— Black Black TMC switch failure
Remedy;1 Check the toner metering cam (A) on the rear of the black cartridge. Note: In some cartridges, the toner metering cam is black. Is the cam present on the cartridge? Go to step 2 If the toner metering cam is not present, check the printer to make sure it is not inside. Replace the damaged cartridge. 2 Check the TMC pin (B) in the black cartridge contact assembly to make sure it moves freely. Does the pin move freely? Go to step 3 Replace the cartridge contact assembly. See “Cartridge contact assembly removal”. 3 Go to “BASE SENSOR TEST”, and check the black TMC sensor. When you press the TMC pin in the black cartridge contact assembly, make sure it actuates the TMC switch on the developer HVPS. When the TMC pin is pressed in, you hear a click when the switch actuates. Check for mechanical interference between the contact block and the developer HVPS. Note: You may need to turn the printer off to hear the click. Does the black TMC switch on the developer HVPS board actuate properly when the TMC pin is pressed? Replace the cartridge. Go to step 4 4 Check the developer HVPS board to make sure it is not cracked or broken. Is the developer HVPS cracked or broken? Go to step 6 Go to step 5 5 Check the mounting of the developer HVPS. Make sure the screws that mount the power supply are properly tightened down and the board is positioned and mounted correctly. Is the developer HVPS mounted correctly? Replace the developer HVPS assembly. See “Developer HVPS board removal”. If the board is incorrectly installed, install it correctly. Make sure all the mounting screws are tightened down. Recheck the printer to see if a 943 Error is still displayed. 6 Make sure the developer HVPS cable is correctly installed on the developer board assembly. Is the cable correctly installed? Go to step 7 Correctly connect the cable. 7 Make sure the developer HVPS cable is correctly installed at J6 on the system board. Is the cable properly installed? Go to step 8 Correctly install the cable. 8 Check the voltage at connector J6-1 on the system board while pressing the black TMC pin in the cartridge contact assembly. Does the voltage change when the pin is pressed? Replace the system board. See “System board removal”. Go to step 9 9 Check the voltage at connector J6-1 when the black TMC switch is pressed. Does the voltage measure approximately +3.3 V dc? Go to step 10 Go to step 11 10 Check the developer HVPS to system board cable for damage, broken connections, or wire and shorts between adjacent pins. Are there any signs of damage to the cable? Replace the cable. Replace the developer HVPS board. See “Developer HVPS board removal”. 11 Disconnect the developer HVPS cable from connector J6 on the system board. Measure the voltage on connector J14-1 on the system board. Does the voltage measure approximately 0 V dc? Replace the system board. See “System board removal”. Replace the developer HVPS and developer HVPS to system board cable.
