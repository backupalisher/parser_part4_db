Board check • Check if the connector (CN131, CN132) on the SYS board and the connector (CN330, CN329) on the LGC board are completely inserted. • Check if the connector pin between the SYS board connectors (CN131, CN132) and the LGC board connectors (CN330, CN329) is disconnected. • Check if the connector CN314 on the LGC board and the connector CN512 on the PS-ACC are completely inserted. • Check if the conductor patterns on the LGC board and SYS board are short circuited or open circuited Harness • Connector check • Harness check LGC board • 25/30/35 ppm: Measure the voltage on TP33 on the LGC board. Then check that the measured voltage is 3.3V. If the voltage does not output, replace the LGC board. • 45/50 ppm: Measure the voltage on TP18 on the LGC board. Then check that the measured voltage is 3.3V. If the voltage does not output, replace the LGC board.
Code;F090
Description;SRAM abnormality on the SYS board
Causes;SRAM SYS board
Remedy;SRAM 1. Check that the SRAM is installed properly. 2. Shut down the equipment. 3. Perform [FS-08]. 4. Press [CLASSIC]. 5. When “SRAM REQUIRES INITIALIZATION” appears on the LCD screen, confirm the destination and press the [START] button. If the destination is incorrect, enter the number for the correct one and press the [START] button. 6. When the confirmation message appears on the LCD screen, press [INITIALIZE]. (SRAM initialization starts.) 7. Enter the serial number of the equipment correctly. (FS-08- 9601) 8. Initialize the NIC information. (FS-08-9083) 9. Shut down the equipment. 10.Perform [FS-05]. 11.Press [CLASSIC]. 12.Perform “Data transfer of characteristic value of scanner”. (FS-05-3203, FS-05-3240) 13.By using the [4] [TEST PRINT] test pattern, perform “Automatic gamma adjustment” <PPC>. (FS-05-7869) 14.By using the [70] [TEST PRINT] test pattern, perform “Automatic gamma adjustment” <PRT>. (FS-05-8008) 15.Reboot the equipment. 16.If the error still occurs, replace the SRAM. SYS board Board check
Code;F350
Description;SYS board abnormality
Causes;SYS board
Remedy;SYS board Board check Combination of the firmware version • Check the combination of the firmware version of the system firmware, system software, engine firmware, and scanner firmware. • Reinstall the firmware of correct combination.
