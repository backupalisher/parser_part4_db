Code;EB50
Description;Paper left on the transport path due to multiple feeding. The multiple feeding of preceding paper caused the misfeeding of upcoming paper.
Causes;Registration sensor MAIN board Rollers on the transport path
Remedy;1 Open the right cover. Is there any paper on the transport path? Remove paper if there is any on the transport path. 2 2 Is the registration sensor working? (Perform the input check: 03-[A]/[A]) Yes Check the rollers. Replace them if they are worn out No 3 3 MAIN board 1. Check if the connector CN22 on the MAIN board is disconnected. 2. Check if the connector pins are disconnected or the harnesses are open circuited. 3. Check if the conductor patterns on the MAIN board are short circuited or open circuited.
Code;EB60
Description;Paper left on the transport path due to multiple feeding. The multiple feeding of preceding paper caused the misfeeding of upcoming paper (re-detection after no jam is detected at EB50 error)
Causes;Registration sensor MAIN board Rollers on the transport path
Remedy;1 Open the right cover. Is there any paper on the transport path? Yes Remove the paper. No 2 2 Is the registration sensor working? (Perform the input check in the test mode: 03-[A]/ [A]) Yes 3 No • Check if the connector CN22 on the MAIN board is disconnected. • Check if the connector of the registration sensor is disconnected. • Check if the connector pins are disconnected and the harnesses are open circuited. • Check if the conductor pattern on the MAIN board is short circuited or open circuited. • Replace the registration sensor. • Replace the MAIN board. 3 Roller • Check the rollers. Replace them if they are worn out.
Code;F070
Description;Communication error between system CPU and main CPU
Causes;MAIN board
Remedy;Check ROM version Check the version of the system ROM. Check the version of the engine ROM version. Board check
Code;F090
Description;Memory abnormality on the MAIN board.
Causes;Memory (IC24) on the MAIN board
Remedy;1. Turn the power off, and start up the Setting Mode (08). 2. When ¡§TEST MODE D¡¨ is displayed on the control panel, key in code: 9080 and press the [START] key. Notes: Code: 9080 cannot be keyed in except when 08-9010 is ON. To set the 08-9010, if this is the case, key in 08-9010-[START] -CLEAR]-key in [1]-[OK]. 3. When ¡§SELECT DESTINATION¡¨ is displayed, use the keys to select a direction and press the [OK] key. 4. When MC=9080¡¨ is displayed on the control panel, press the [OK] key. To cancel, press the [CANCEL] key. 5. If flash memory clear ends normally,INITIALISE=OK¡¨ is displayed on the control panel, it automatically changes to the initial screen of the 08 mode. 6. Perform the initialization after the software version upgrade (08-9030). 7. Display the serial number (08-9601) and check the serial number. Key in the correct serial number using 08-9601 if the serial number is different from the serial number on the identification plate on the back cover. 8. Set the 08-9010 to. 9. Turn the power off and then on, if the error is not corrected, replace the flash memory on the main board.
Code;F901
Description;Engine speed error. The speed information of the MAIN board is damaged. The MAIN board in which is not corresponding to the equipment model is installed.
Causes;Harness MAIN board
Remedy;"Harness Check if there is no problem in the harness for connecting to the following connector. MAIN board: CN15 MAIN board Check if the MAIN board in which is corresponded to the equipment model is installed. Check if the label color of the MAIN board (indicated in the figure with the arrow) is corresponded to the equipment model (indicated on the rating label). 25S: Yellow (MJD) / White (Other than MJD) 25H: Pink 25F: Yellowish green E Position of the label to be checked If they are not corresponding correctly, replace the MAIN board with the correct one by referring to the procedures described below.
