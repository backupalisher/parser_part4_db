Remedy;"<Check of the status of color registration sensor error> 1. While pressing [0] and [5] simultaneously, turn the power ON. 2. Enter [461] with digital keys and press the [START] key. 3. The color registration control result is displayed in four values (Y(0), M(1), C(2), K(3)). 4. Check the value for Y(0) displayed in 3.. When [CF1] has occured, a value from 1 to 15 is displayed (normal if 0 or 16 or above). 1-14: Data error (color registration sensor is normal) 15: Reading error of color registration test pattern <Disabling the color registration control> 5. While pressing [0] and [8] simultaneously, turn the power ON. 6. Enter [742] with digital keys and press the [START] key. 7. Set the color registration control setting to ""1"" (manual). 8. Enter [743] with digital keys and press the [START] key. 9. Set the color registration control during the warming-up to ""0"" (disabled). 10.Turn the power OFF. <Check by the forced performing of color registration control > 11.While pressing [0] and [5] simultaneously, turn the power ON. 12.Enter [407] with digital keys and press the [START] key. - (Forced performing of color registration control) * At this time, use a digital tester to monitor the test point TP29 (front color registration sensor output) and TP28 (rear color registration sensor output) on the LGC board. . If the outputs are normal . Before starting the forced performing of color registration control, a voltage of approximately 0.7V DC is displayed. After starting it, the voltage changes to approximately 4.4V DC, and this may drop instantaneously down to 0.7V DC. (There may be no fluctuations in voltage, depending on the reaction speed of the digital tester.) When the forced performing of color registration control is finished, the voltage returns to approximately 0.7V DC. <Check by the grid pattern> 13.While pressing [0] and [5] simultaneously, turn the power ON. 14.Enter ""1"" with digital key and press the [PRINTER/NETWORK] key. 15.Check the output grid patterns of yellow, magenta, cyan and black if there is image density difference among the front/center/rear areas or abnormality in the overall image. * At this time, there is no problem even if the Y, M, C and K grid patterns are out of alignment. – If there is difference in tonal balance between the front and rear areas – • Check the state of contact of the photoconductive drum and the transfer belt. • Check the quantity of developer (check whether developer material is properly supplied onto the surface of the developer sleeve). – If there is any streak of yellow, magenta, cyan or black streak in the secondary-scanning direction – • Check if there is any stain or dust on the main charger wire that corresponds to the color of the streak. – If there is any white streak in the secondary-scanning direction – • Check if there is any stain or dust on the slit glass of the laser optical unit. – If the entire page is solid in a specific color – • Abnormality of the main high-voltage transformer corresponding to that color or abnormalityof the laser optical unit. Of the four main high-voltage transformers, exchange the main high-voltage transformer considered to be abnormal for other main high-voltage transformer considered to be normal, and then output the chart again. If the solid color over the entire page changes as the result of exchanging the main high-voltage transformer, that main high-voltage transformer is abnormal. If the solid color over the entire page does not change, check whether there is any disconnection of the harness between the LGC board and the main high-voltage transformer or whether the power supplys to the main charger (disconnection of high-voltage harness or contact defects). If there is no problem, check the laser optical unit. If the density is low on both front and rear sides and any of the above abnormalities are not found, make the following check. <Check by the gradation pattern> 16.While pressing [0] and [5] simultaneously, turn the power ON. 17.Enter ""4"" with digital key and press the [PRINTER/NETWORK] key. 18.Check the output gradation images for gamma adjustment if there is any abnormality in the gradation of yellow, magenta, cyan and black. – If there are any abnormalities – (1) Check if the photoconductive drum and transfer belt are operating. If not, correct any mechanical problems. (2) Check if the transfer belt unit is raised fully upward. (3) Check if the transfer/transport unit is inserted securely. (4) Check the surface of the transfer belt for any abnormal stain, large flaw or break. (5) Check if the connector of the transfer transformer is disconnected. (6) Check if any of the high-voltage harnesses of the main high-voltage transformer/ transfer transformer is disconnected. (7) Check the harness between the LGC board and the transfer transformer if it is open-circuited. (8) Check the high-voltage contacts of the transfer belt unit if they are contacting properly or if they are not dirty. (9) Check if any of the high-voltage harnesses is disconnected. (10) Check if the connector J113, J114 or J119 on the LGC board is disconnected. (11) Check if the connector J181, J182, J185 or J188 on the IMC board is disconnected. (12) Check if the harness between the LGC board and the color registration sensor is open-circuited. (13) Check if the color registration sensor connector is disconnected. (14) Check if any of the main high-voltage transformer connectors is disconnected. (15) Check if any of the harnesses between the LGC board and the main high-voltage transformers is open-circuited. (16) Replace the transfer transformer. (17) Replace the main high-voltage transformer. 19. Check the sensor detection area of the transfer belt for any damage, and if damaged, replace the transfer belt. 20. Check the emitting/receiving area of the color registration sensor if it is not dirty. * Be sure to do the following after having made checks and corrections: 1. While pressing [0] and [8] simultaneously, turn ON the power. 2. Enter [742] with digital keys and press the [START] key. 3. Set the color registration control setting to ""0"" (automatic). 4. Enter [743] with digital keys and press the [START] key. 5. Set the color registration control during warming-up setting to ""1"" (enabled). 6. Turn OFF the power."
