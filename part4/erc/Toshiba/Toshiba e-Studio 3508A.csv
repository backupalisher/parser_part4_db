Description;SRAM abnormality on the SYS board
Causes;SRAM SYS board
Remedy;SRAM 1. Check that the SRAM is installed properly. 2. Shut down the equipment. 3. Perform [FS-08]. 4. Press [CLASSIC]. 5. When “SRAM REQUIRES INITIALIZATION” appears on the LCD screen, confirm the destination and press the [START] button. If the destination is incorrect, enter the number for the correct one and press the [START] button. 6. When the confirmation message appears on the LCD screen, press [INITIALIZE]. (SRAM initialization starts.) 7. Enter the serial number of the equipment correctly. (FS-08- 9601) 8. Initialize the NIC information. (FS-08-9083) 9. Shut down the equipment. 10.Perform [FS-05]. 11.Press [CLASSIC]. 12.Perform “Data transfer of characteristic value of scanner”. (FS-05-3203, FS-05-3240) 13.By using the [4] [TEST PRINT] test pattern, perform “Automatic gamma adjustment” <PPC>. (FS-05-7869) 14.By using the [70] [TEST PRINT] test pattern, perform “Automatic gamma adjustment” <PRT>. (FS-05-8008) 15.Reboot the equipment. 16.If the error still occurs, replace the SRAM.
