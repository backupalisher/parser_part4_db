Causes;DSDF jam • The jam access cover of the DSDF has become opened during its operation. • The DSDF exit motor has been driven and the DSDF shading sheet HP sensor has not been turned ON within a specified time. Details: If a paper jam has occurred at the start of a duplex copying or scanning job or at the end of a copying or scanning job, the cover may have opened as a result. The home position detection is carried out by the DSDF shading sheet HP sensor when the cover or DSDF is closed, the power is turned ON, during the initial operation or at the end of a job. This home position detection checks that the DSDF shading sheet HP sensor is turned ON within a specified time after the DSDF exit motor has started driving. If the home position cannot be detected when the cover or DSDF is closed or the power is turned ON, a cover open error will be displayed. If the home position cannot be detected during the initial operation or at the end of a job, a DSDF shading sheet HP sensor abnormality will occur and this error code will be displayed.
