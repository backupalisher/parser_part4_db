If the lamp does not come on do the following: • If not previously removed, remove the redrive assembly. See “Redrive assembly removal”8. • Remove the fuser assembly. See “Fuser assembly removal”. • Make sure the correct type of lamp is installed (voltage and wattage). • Verify that the fuser to fuser lamp cable is installed correctly to the fuser top cover assembly. If incorrect, install correctly; if correct, go to step 2. 2 AC line voltage CAUTION: When taking measurements for AC power, observe all safety precautions. Check the AC line voltage to make sure it is within operating specification. If incorrect, inform the customer; if correct, go to step 3. 3 LVPS CAUTION: When taking measurements for AC power, observe all safety precautions. Unplug the AC line cord from the printer and pull the LVPS out far enough to access CN1 on the LVPS board (see “Low voltage power supply removal”9). Disconnect the LVPS to fuser AC cable, plug in the line cord, turn the printer on and measure the voltage between CN1-1 and CN1-3 on the connector (see the connector locations at “Low voltage power supply”). If incorrect, replace the LVPS assembly (see “Low voltage power supply removal”9); if correct, go to step 4. 4 Fuser lamp Fuser top cover assembly Fuser connect cable (fuser to fuser lamp cable) Check continuity of the fuser to fuser AC cable, fuser top cover assembly, and fuser lamp by checking the continuity between the two pins on the fuser lamp AC cable connector: • If there is continuity, go to step 5. • If there is no continuity, check the continuity of the fuser to fuser lamp AC cable. If incorrect, replace the lamp, if incorrect, replace the fuser top cover assembly. Note: If the fuser lamp is replaced, allow the fuser assembly to cool or a 925.xx error may be displayed. 5 LVPS LVPS to fuser AC cable CAUTION: When taking measurements for AC power, observe all safety precautions. Check the AC line voltage between the pins on the fuser end of the LPVS to fuser AC cable. If the voltage is correct, unplug the AC power cord from the LVPS cable. If the voltage is correct, unplug the AC power cord from the LVPS, pull the LVPS out far enough to be able to check the voltage between CN-1 and CN1-3 on the LVPS board. Plug in the power cord, turn the printer on and check the voltage. If correct, replace the LVPS to fuser AC cable; if incorrect, replace the LVPS assembly. Note: If the fuses in the LVPS are blown, the LVPS assembly must be replaced. 6 Fuser top cover assembly (thermistor, thermistor cable) Fuser to system board DC cable Check to make sure that the thermistor is installed correctly to J5 on the fuser control card.
