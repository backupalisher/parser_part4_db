Description;Image quality control test pattern abnormality: The test pattern is not formed normally
Causes;
Remedy;1 Use “Image quality control abnormal detection counter Y to K display/0 clearing (08- 2528 to 2531)” to check the abnormal occurring condition for each color. 2 Check “Output value display of image quality sensor / High-density pattern (05- 2731-0 to 3)” to check if the high-density pattern abnormality occurs for each color and identify the color which pattern is abnormal. If the value is 628 or above, it is defined as high-density pattern abnormality. Under 628 (Y, M, C and K) 3 628 or above (Y, M, C and K) High-density pattern abnormality Check if the laser shutter is working properly. <Procedure> 1. Take off the process unit so that the laser shutter can be easily seen. Clean around the laser shutter if the developer has been spilled over. 2. While pressing the digital keys [0] and [3] simultaneously, turn the power ON. 3. Key in “201”. 4. Press the [START] button and check if the shutter is opened and then closed (reciprocating 1cycle). Check if the developer unit has been installed properly. 1. Visually check the installation status of the developer unit, and correct it if there is any abnormality. To (8) (If you have already performed this checking cycle once, proceed to step (3).) 3 Set the values of “Image quality closed-loop control / Contrast voltage (08-2486)” and “Drum surface potential sensor control setting (08- 2561)” to “0” (Invalid). 4 Perform “Enforced performing of image quality open-loop control (05- 2740)”. 5 Output the image quality control test pattern (04-270) more than one time and the list print ([9][START]) in the adjustment mode (05), and check the patch of the color identified in step (1) to see if the image is abnormal. Normal 6 Abnorm al Abnormal image: Blank print, Solid print, White banding, Color banding, White spots, Poor transfer, Uneven image density, Faded image (low density), Uneven light distribution, Blotched image. Blank print: including when one of the YMCK colors is not printed. ‚ Correct the abnormal image. Proceed to step (7). 6 Replace the image quality sensor or LGC board. 7 Set the values of “Image quality closed-loop control / Contrast voltage (08-2486)” and “Image quality closedloop control / Laser power (08-2561)” to “1” (Valid). 8 Perform “Image quality closed-loop control (05- 2742)” and make sure it is completed normally. (Error [CE40] does not appear.) Then perform “Automatic gamma adjustment”. Normal 9 When an error occurs Check and correct it accordingly. 9 Clear all “Image quality control abnormal detection counter Y to K display/0 clearing (08-2528 to 2531)”. 10 Check if any of the springs for supplying power to the transfer belt unit is deformed. Replace the spring if it is deformed.
