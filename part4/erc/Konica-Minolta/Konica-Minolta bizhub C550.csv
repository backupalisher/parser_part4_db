Description;"Main backup media access error
 • Contact the responsible people of KMBT before taking some countermeasures."
Remedy;1 Check the connector (CN23PRCB) on PRCB, the connector (CN1SV ERB) on SV ERB, and the harness between the boards for proper connection and correct as necessary. 2 Change PRCB 1. Turn OFF the main power switch and replace the current PRCB with a new one. (When using a PRCB of another machine in service, be sure to use a PRCB installed in the same model.) 2. Update the PRCB firmware. 3. After completing the firmware update, turn OFF and ON the main power switch and check to see that warm-up is started. Make sure that malfunction codes other than C2650 or improper IU/TC placement is not detected. 4. When the trouble cannot be solved, reinstall the removed PRCB to the original board. NOTE • When taking the above steps, check whether PRCB is defective or not without replacing the SV ERB. 3 Change SV ERB 1. Replace the current SV ERB with a new one. 2. Turn ON the main power switch and check to see that warm-up is started. (One minute is spent to prepare the new SV ERB for use. During the period, the control panel backlight stays off.) Make sure that malfunction codes other than C2650 or improper IU/TC placement is not detected. 3. Make the specified readjustments. 4 If the above actions do not solve the problem, contact KMBT.
