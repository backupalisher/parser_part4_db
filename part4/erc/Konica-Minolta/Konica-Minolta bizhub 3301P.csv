You will need the following information: • Exact 900.xx error digits and complete error message • Printed menu settings page • Printed network settings page • Device error log • A sample print file if the error appears to be isolated to a single file • File/Application used if the error is related to specific print file • Device operating system • Driver used (PCL/PS) • Frequency of the occurrence of the error
Code;912.xx
Description;Unrecoverable Engine firmware error POR the machine. If the error re-occurs, then update the firmware. If the error continues occurring, then replace the controller board.
Remedy;Controller board removal.
Code;940.xx
Description;RIP to engine communication failure-the zero crossing signal used for fuser control in the low voltage (LV) power supply has failed, or the wrong low voltage power supply has been installed.
Remedy;Step 1 1. Check the power cord for continuity. If necessary, replace. 2. Make sure the nominal voltage source is within specification. See Electrical specifications. Does the problem remain? Go to step 2. The problem is solved. Step 2 Check if the power supply cable is properly connected to the controller board. Is it properly connected? Go to step 3. Reseat the cables. Step 3 1. Turn off the printer. 2. Remove the power cord. 3. Measure the resistance between terminals A and D of the power supply socket. Is the resistance approximately 30 ohms? Contact your next level of support. Replace the power supply. See Power supply removal.
Code;948.xx
Description;Failed engine card-pel clock check failed.
Remedy;Replace the controller board.
Code;949.xx
Description;Failed engine card-delay line calibration failure.
Remedy;Replace the controller board.
Code;950.xx
Description;"NVRAM mismatch failure - mismatch between controller board EEPROM and control panel mirror. "".xx"" codes: • 00-29 - mismatch between system and mirror • 30-60 - mismatch between secure and system"
Remedy;Warning - Potential Damage: When replacing any of the following components: • Control panel assembly • Controller board assembly Replace only one component at a time. Replace the required component and perform a POR before replacing a second component listed above. If this procedure is not followed, the printer will be rendered inoperable. Never replace two or more of the components listed above without a POR after installing each one or the printer will be rendered inoperable. Warning - Potential Damage: These components can be used as a method of troubleshooting as long as the machine is booted into diagnostic mode or is operating in diagnostic mode. Once a component has been installed in a machine and powered up into user mode, it cannot be used in another machine. It must be returned to the manufacturer. Step 1 Check the control panel assembly. Was the control panel assembly recently replaced? Go to step 3. Go to step 2. Step 2 Check the controller board assembly. Was the controller board assembly recently replaced? Go to step 4. Contact next level of support. Step 3 Replace the current control panel assembly with the original control panel assembly. Go to Control panel assembly removal. Does the error remain? Go to step 5. The problem is solved. Step 4 Replace the current controller board assembly with the original controller board assembly. Go to Controller board removal. Does the problem continue? Go to step 6. The problem is solved. Step 5 Replace the original control panel assembly with a new and not previously installed control panel assembly. Does the error continue? Contact the next level of support. The problem is solved. Step 6 Replace the original control panel assembly with a new and not previously installed control panel door assembly. Does the error continue? Contact the next level of support. The problem is solved.
Code;952.xx
Description;A recoverable NVRAM Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error occurred-n is the offset at which the error occurred.
Remedy;POR the printer. Does the error remain? Contact the next level of support. The problem is solved.
Code;953.xx ... 958.xx
Description;953.xx NVRAM chip failure with mirror part. 954.xx NVRAM chip failure with system part. 955.xx The Code ROM or NAND flash failed the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) or the NAND experienced an uncorrectable multi-bit failure. 956.xx RIP card failure-processor failure. 956.01 Processor temperature is over the limit. 957.xx RIP card failure-ASIC failure. 958.xx Controller Board NAND Failure-printer has performed more than 100 shift and reflash operations as a result of ECC bit corrections.
Remedy;Replace the controller board.
