Reinstall or reconnect IDCS1, connectors connecting between IDCS1-relay CN70-BASEB CN22E, if any of the foregoing parts is installed or connected improperly. 4. Clean IDCS1, if it is dirty. 5. Check the connector between HVPS CN1-BASEB CN4E for proper connection. 6. Open/close the front door, run an image stabilization sequence, and select [Service Mode] -> [State Confirmation] -> [Level History 1] to check the IDC value. IDC1: IDCS1 If the value is 1.0 V or less, replace IDCS1. 7. Replace BASEB.
Code;P-6 ... P-9
Description;Imaging unit (C) failure, Imaging unit (M) failure, Imaging unit (Y) failure, Imaging unit (K) failure All density readings taken from the density pattern produced on the transfer belt are 1.0 g/m2 (IDC sensor photo receiver output) or less during max. density adjustment (Vg/Vdc adjustment).
Causes;• Imaging unit/Y,M,C,K • Transfer belt unit • IDC sensor (IDCS1) • Base board (BASEB) • High voltage unit (HVPS)
Remedy;1. Check the setting value in [Max Image Density Adj] of [Service Mode] -> [Imaging Process Adjustment] and, if it is negative, readjust. 2. Check the drive transmission portion of the imaging unit and correct as necessary. 3. Clean IDCS1 window if dirty. 4. Clean the contact of the imaging unit connector if dirty. 5. Check the connector between HVPS CN1-BASEB CN4E for proper connection. 6. Replace the imaging unit. 7. Replace the transfer belt unit. 8. Replace HVPS. 9. Replace BASEB.
Code;S-1
Description;Light adjustment failure It is detected that the LED duty adjustment value of CIS is faulty.
Causes;• CIS module (IR CIS) • CIS relay board (CISRYB) • Base board (BASEB)
Remedy;Procedure 1. Correct the harness connection between IR CIS-CISRYB CN1 if faulty. 2. Correct the harness connection between CISRYB CN2-BASEB CN6 if faulty. 3. Check for possible extraneous light and correct as necessary. 4. Replace IR CIS. 5. Replace CISRYB. 6. Replace BASEB.
