Description;Abort code. MFP Control Board error
Remedy;• MFP board (MFPB) • DSC board/1 (DSCB/1) • DSC board/2 (DSCB/2) • EFI relay board (EFIRYB: VI-506) • Dual scan image processing board (DSIPB)
Code;CF001...CFFE7
Description;Abort code • MFP board (MFPB) • Memory board/1 (MEMB/1) • Memory board/2 (MEMB/2) • EFI board (EFIRYB: VI-506) • Dual scan image processing board (DSIPB) • DSC board/1 (DSCB/1: Security kit SC-508) • DSC board/2 (DSCB/2: Security kit SC-508) • Hard disk (HDD)
Remedy;"1 Main power switch Turn OFF and ON the main power switch, and check if the Abort code appears again. NO When not reappearing, continuous use is carried out, and it is checked whether an abort code occurs. 2 Connector connection Check the connector for proper connection and correct as necessary. • MFP board (MFPB) • Memory board/1 (Standard memory: MEMB/1) • Memory board/2 (Expansion memory: MEMB/2) • EFI board (EFIRYB: VI-506) • Dual scan image processing board (DSIPB) • DSC board/1 (DSCB/1: SC-508) • DSC board/2 (DSCB/2: SC-508) • Hard disc (HDD) NO It will correct, if connector connection has abnormalities. 3 Firmware Update the firmware to the latest version, and check if the Abort code appears again. NO After conducting firmware updating, check the firmware version No. and confirm that the firmware has been normally updated. 4 Memory Check Conduct the following setting. [Service Mode] -> [State Confirmation] -> [Memory/ HDD Adj.] -> [Memory Check] -> [Rough Check]. NO When ""NG"" is displayed, replace the appropriate memory or PWB. • WORK0: Standard memory (MEMB/1) • WORK1: Expansion memory (MEMB/2) • FILE0,1: MFP board (MFPB) • FILE2,3: EFI board (EFIRYB: VI-506) • FILE4,5: Dual scan image processing board (DSIPB) 5 HDD R/W Check Conduct the following setting. [Service Mode] -> [State Confirmation] -> [Memory/ HDD Adj.] -> [HDD R/W Check]. NO When ""NG"" is displayed, replace the hard disk (HDD). 6 JPEG Check Conduct the following setting. [Service Mode] -> [State Confirmation] -> [Memory/ HDD Adj.] -> [JPEG Check]. NO When ""NG"" is displayed, Check the MFPB. 7 MFP board Replace MFPB NO Other electric parts indicated to Component of abort code list are replaceed."
