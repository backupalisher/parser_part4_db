Description;Unusual Noises Use this procedure to isolate unusual noises. NOTE: Due to the intermittent nature of unusual noises, this RAP can only give guidance on how to isolate noises. This RAP will not find all possible causes. When machines become old and worn, unusual noises may arise that are not covered in this RAP.
Remedy;1. Ask the customer to demonstrate the function that generates the unusual noise. 2. Check the fault and error logs. 3. Cycle system power. Wait while the printer performs a normal initialization and warm-up. 4. Run the machine in all modes. Also use the diagnostics to run individual components. Go to the relevant subsection: • DADF • Scanner • Bypass Tray • Tray 1 • Optional Feeder Assembly • Exit Path • Fans DADF Possible causes and potential solutions are: • Grinding noise. Possible causes are: – Feed bearinga can stick, preventing the feed roll from free wheeling as the document is transported. – Large flat spots, confined to one or two areas on the retard roll, which causes feed noise and an increase in jams. Solution: – Install a new Pick-up Module, PL 21.1 Item 97. – Replace the DADF . • Noise from the DADH input tray. Possible causes are: – Document guides. Solution: – Clean the DADF input tray in the area below the input guides with antistatic fluid. • Squeaks from the DADH. Possible causes are: – DADF exit roll assembly or take away roll assembly. Solution: – Remove and clean the shafts and plastic bushes with antistatic fluid. • Knocking noise. Possible causes are: – The feed motor not tensioned correctly, causing the drive belts to slip. Solution: – Replace the DADF . • Gear rattle. Possible causes are: – A loose meshing of the clutch and motor gears. Solution: – Replace the DADF . Scanner Possible causes and potential solutions are: • Grinding. Possible causes are: – The scan carriage is moving erratically and the scan motor is generating a grinding sound. The teeth of the scanner drive belt are not engaging with the capstan on the scan motor. Solution: – Replace the Scanner . Bypass Tray Run the following components: • Combine dC330 code 071.001, Main Drive Assembly, and 071.004, MSI Feed Solenoid to test Bypass Tray feed components. Possible causes and potential solutions are: • No drive or a knocking noise. Possible causes are: – Incorrectly aligned or damaged parts. – Contamination of the drive shafts and the bearings. Solution: – Check the Bypass Pick-up Assembly, PL 13.1 Item 15. – Adjust or install new components as necessary. Tray 1 Remove Tray 1 and run the following components: • Enter dC330 code 071.001 to run the Main Drive Assembly. Possible causes and potential solutions are: • Squeaks. Possible causes are: – Contamination of the Transport Assembly shafts and bearings. – Incorrectly aligned or damaged parts. Solution: – Clean the Feed Rollers and shafts.Replace if necessary . – Check Transport Assembly. Install new parts as necessary, PL 15.2. – Check the Tray for parts that are damaged or out of position. – Adjust or install new components as necessary. Optional Feeder Assembly NOTE: Instructions are provided for Tray 2. Troubleshoot other Optional Feeder Assemblies using the codes applicable to the Optional Feeder under test. Remove Tray 2 and run the following components: • Enter dC330 code 071.009 to operate the Tray 2 Feed Motor, PL 11.1 Item 7. • Check tray lift by removing the tray and letting the tray drop, then push the tray back in. Possible causes and potential solutions are: • No drive or a knocking noise from the Feed Motor. Possible causes are: – Feed Motor, PL 11.1 Item 7 – Worn drive gears – Failed Feed Clutch, PL 11.1 Item 8 Solution: – Check the Feed Motor and Feed Clutch connections. – Check the Optional Feeder Assembly connection to the printer. – Check that the tray moves freely inside the feeder assembly. – Adjust or install new components as necessary. Exit Path Run the following components: • Combine dC330 code 071.001 Main Drive Assembly and 071.007 exit clutch to run the exit transport. • Combine dC330 code 071.001 Main Drive Assembly) and 071.008 exit invert clutch to run the duplex transport. Used for duplex and paper invert. Possible causes: • Exit Drive Assembly, PL 3.1 Item 2 • Exit Invert Drive Assembly, PL 3.1 Item 3 • Exit Chute Assembly, PL 17.1 Item 99 Solution: • If the noise repeats, identify the source and install new parts as necessary. Fans Run the following components: • Enter dC330 code 042.001 to run the Rear Fan. • Enter dC330 code 042.003 to run the LVPS Fan. Possible causes: – Bearings in the cooling fans have worn or failed. – Incorrectly aligned or damaged parts. Solution: – Check for parts that are damaged or out of position. – Adjust or install new components as necessary.
