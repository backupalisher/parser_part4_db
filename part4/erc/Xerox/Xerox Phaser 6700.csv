Is 3.3V available at P/J24-4 when the Front Interlock Switch is closed? Replace the MCU Board. Go to Step 7. 12 Check continuity of the LVPS Harness between P/J308 and PJ24 on the MCU Board. The harness in undamaged. Replace the LVPS. Replace the harness. 13 If the error persists, replace these components, in order, until the error is resolved. 1.

Code;92-670-00 ... 92-673-00
Description;Imaging Unit Failure A calibration patch error (low image density) was detected. • 92-670-00 Yellow Imaging Unit Failure • 92-671-00 Magenta Imaging Unit Failure • 92-672-00 Cyan Imaging Unit Failure • 92-673-00 Black Imaging Unit Failure
Causes;• Yellow Imaging Unit, PL5.1.8 • Magenta Imaging Unit, PL5.1.9 • Cyan Imaging Unit, PL5.1.10 • Black Imaging Unit, PL5.1.11 • Transfer Belt, PL5.1.1 • HVPS, PL5.2.3 • Harness Assy ROS/HV (PL11.2.2) • MCU Board, PL10.2.18
Remedy;1 Reseat the affected Imaging Unit and cycle system power. Does the error persist? Go to Step 2. Complete. 2 Replace the affected imaging Unit. Does the error persist? Go to Step 3. Complete. 3 Reseat the Transfer Belt and cycle system power. Does the error persist? Go to Step 4. Complete. 4 Replace the Transfer Belt. Does the error persist? Go to Step 5. Complete. 5 Check P/J332 on the HVPS and the HV contacts to the Bias Transfer Assy. The connections are secure. Go to Step 6. Secure the connections. 6 Check P/J13 on the MCU Board and P/J331 on the HVPS. The connections are secure. Go to Step 5. Secure the connections. 7 Check continuity of the ROS/HV Harness between P/J331 and PJ31 on the MCU Board. The harness in undamaged. Replace the HVPS. Replace the MCU Board. 8 If the error persists, replace these components, in order, until the error is resolved. 1. Bias Housing Assy, PL 5.2.2 2.HVPS, PL5.2.3 3.

Code;93-901-00 ... 93-907-00
Description;CMYK Toner Failure A communication or CRUM data failure was detected in one of the Toner Cartridges. • 93-901-00 Black (K) Toner Failure • 93-903-00 Yellow (Y) Toner Failure • 93-905-00 Magenta (M) Toner Failure • 93-907-00 Cyan (C) Toner Failure
Causes;• Yellow Toner Cartridge, PL6.1.1 • Magenta Toner Cartridge, PL6.1.2 • Cyan Toner Cartridge, PL6.1.3 • Black Toner Cartridge, PL6.1.4 • CRUM Connector Assy, PL6.1.10 • MCU Board, PL10.2.18 • Harness TN CRUM, PL11.1.1
Remedy;1 Reseat the affected Toner Cartridge and cycle system power. Does the error persist? Go to Step 2. Complete. 2 Replace the affected Toner Cartridge. Does the error persist? Go to Step 3. Complete. 3 Check P/J11 on the MCU Board and toner CRUM connections P/J204(Y), P/J205(M), P/J206(C) and P/ J207(K). The connections are secure. Go to Step 4. Secure the connections. 4 Check continuity of the TN/CRUM Harness between the CRUM connections and P/J11 on the MCU Board. The harness in undamaged. Go to Step 5. Replace the harness. 5 Check for 2.5V at P/J11-3, -7, -11, and -15 on the MCU Board Is 2.5 V available at P/J11? Replace the Toner CRUM Connector Assy. Replace the MCU Board.
