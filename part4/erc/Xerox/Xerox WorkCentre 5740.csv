Torn fragments can pass through the IOT and 2K LCSS paper path without causing a problem until they finally wedge themselves at some point. A likely place for a piece of paper to be wedged is at the hole punch assembly, where the top and bottom guides form the narrowest part of the paper path. • Ensure that the shaft diverter assembly, PL 11.22 Item 13, operates correctly and has full movement. • Ensure that the hole punches park at the fully open position. If they protrude even slightly, a jam will occur in the narrow paper path of the hole punch. • Ensure that the jam clearance guide, PL 11.24 Item 6, closes and latches correctly. Check that the magnet at the rear is located and functions correctly. Check the clip at the front is positioned correctly. • Ensure that all idler rolls in the 2K LCSS paper path are free to rotate, particularly those on the jam clearance guide, where the paper turns through 90 degrees. • Ensure that the paper path ribs of the jam clearance guide, PL 11.24 Item 6, and the entry guide cover, PL 11.24 Item 5, are free of “scores” and “nicks”.

Remedy;Check the following: • Check that bin 1 is seated correctly and the bin 1 alignment clip is in position, PL 11.100 Item 13. • Turn over the paper stack in the tray in use. • Use a new ream of paper in the tray in use. • Paper type, especially recycled paper, can lead to registration problems. Try changing to a different brand or type of paper. • Ensure that the guides in the paper trays are correctly set and reported on the UI for the paper size loaded. • Check that paper type is set correctly. If heavyweight paper is used but not set in the UI, the compiler capacity can be exceeded. • Check for obstructions in the compiler. • Ensure that the paddle roll operates correctly and that the paddles are not damaged. The paddles should park completely inside the top section of the compiler, with the shorter paddle in a vertical position. If all of the paddles are out of position, check the paddle roll position sensor, PL 11.104 Item 11, the flag, PL 11.104 Item 7 and the paddle motor assembly, PL 11.104 Item 10. If only one paddle is mis-aligned with the others, it can be re-positioned by hand (they are not bonded to the shaft). • Make sure the paddles are clean. If necessary, use formula A cleaning fluid, PL 26.10 Item 2 to clean the paddles. • Ensure that the tampers operate correctly, i.e. are not stalling or losing position during the job. Inspect the tampers for damage, if necessary install new parts. PL 11.112. • Inspect the bin 1 entry nips for roll damage. The idlers should be held against the rubber driving rolls and they should be free to rotate within their support springs. If necessary, install new parts, PL 11.120. • Inspect the four spring loaded guides on the output cover, PL 11.100 Item 7. Ensure that they are correctly located and are free to move up and down.
