NOTE: The WC 5325/5330/5335 is shipped with “Worldwide Neutral” Toner Cartridges. When the cartridges shipped with the machine are installed, the machine is set to Worldwide Neutral configuration. When the first toner cartridge is replaced in the WC 5325/5330/5335, the Geographic Differentiation Code and Toner Cartridge Type in NVM are automatically changed to the same settings as the replacement cartridge. Once these NVM are set, the WC 5325/5330/5335 toner configuration can only be changed with a CRUM conversion. One or more Toner Cartridges are of the wrong type (i.e., a “Sold” cartridge installed in a “metered” configured machine.
Remedy;1. Turn the power OFF and ON. 2. Check the connection between the MCU PWB P/J404 and the Toner CRUM PWB P/ J102 for open circuit, short circuit, and poor contact. Also, remove and reinstall the Toner Cartridge and check for improper installation. If no problems are found, replace the following parts in sequence: • Toner Cartridge (PL 8.1) • Toner CRUM PWB (PL 8.2) • MCU PWB (PL 18.2) • Go to the 093-926 Toner CRUM Data Mismatch Fail RAP.

Remedy;An Error Message appears on the UI - Reinsert an improperly seated consumable or replace any consumables with Error. Press Machine Status button and select Supplies tab for details. Remove and reinstall the Toner Cartridge and check for improper installation. The problem continues Y↓N→End Check the NVM locations in Table 767-094 Geographic Setting 3 = North America/Europe 12 = DMO 15 = Worldwide 767-104 Contract Type 2 = Sold 3 = Metered 31 = Neutral The NVM values match the expected customer configuration. Y↓N→Determine correct Contract Type from customer. Contact Technical Support Center or your NTS for the CRUM conversion procedure. 1. Polish the connection terminals between the Toner Cartridge CRUM PWB and the Toner CRUM PWB with a dry cloth. (When cleaning, do not use Drum cleaner, etc.) 2. Check the following: • The connection between the MCU PWB P/J404 and the Toner CRUM PWB P/J102 for open circuit, short circuit, and poor contact • The connection terminals between the Toner Cartridge CRUM PWB and the Toner CRUM PWB for damage and foreign substances • The Toner Cartridge for improper installation If no problems are found, replace the following parts in sequence: • Toner Cartridge (K) (PL 8.1) • Toner CRUM PWB (PL 8.2) • MCU PWB (PL 18.2)
