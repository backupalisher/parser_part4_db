Code;11,025.66
Display;11,025.66 DMC_PROG_FAULT(25)
Description;Motion Segment Too Late. The DMC ASIC interrupt to program the event control hardware for the next segment in a motion control profile occurred too late. A motion profile consists of a list of absolute times and motor register values. After the hardware writes a DSP value, the software must program the event control store hardware for the next segment in the profile. This error occurs when any region, PostScript, Network or engine disables interrrupts for a long period of time, preventing the DMC interrupt service routine from running. This may be due to an unintentional coding error or because a task took a CPU exception which is processed with interrupts disabled, taking a long time to execute.
Code;11,029.61
Display;11,029.61 DMC_PROG_FAULT(29)
Description;Motion Segment Too Short. Software attempted to program a motion profile with a motion segment shorter than 750 microseconds. If this specifcation is violated the DMC interrupt service routine may not have time to reload the control store hardware event, when the system is busy.
Code;11,033.65
Display;11,033.65 DMC_PROG_FAULT(33)
Description;Motion Control Event Missed. A missed control store event was detected. A health check routine is called every 400 milliseconds, the A/D update period, and checks that all the currently pending hardware motion profile events are for some time in the future. If one is pending for a time in the past, then it generates this error. A missed DMC interrupt due to interrupts disabled too long, by any region, is a probable cause.

Description;Motion Control Done Timer Too Late. A motion control profile done event could not be programmed. It was too late for the software to program the done event for a motion profile handled by control store event hardware. This error indicates that DMC interrupts were disabled for a long period of time. Almost always, this happens when a non-engine region generates a CPU exception during printing. The operating system processes CPU exceptions with interrupts off and the processing takes a long length of time. The user should check the task name saved with this fault to identify the culprit.
