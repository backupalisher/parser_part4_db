If no problem is found, replace the following parts in sequence: • Drum Cartridge (PL 8.1) • ESS/MCU PWB (PL 18.1)
Code;116-321
Description;Controller Logic Fail • A software defect that cannot be ignored was found in the Controller software. • The CPU has rebooted due to the occurrence of an exception.
Remedy;1. Turn the power OFF and ON. 2. Install a Controller Firmware with the correct version.
Code;116-323
Description;Controller NVM Data Defect Any of the following was detected: • The On Board NVM data of the Controller is corrupted. • The On Board NVM of the Controller is not installed. • Any one of the Print Counter has reached its maximum value. • The number of times the NVM can be changed has reached its limit. NOTE: If this Fault reoccurrs after performing Data Backup/Restore, perform Data Restore again. (Perform NVM Matching (NVM[621-400]) in the CE Mode.)
Remedy;1. Turn the power OFF and ON. 2. Perform NVM Initialize in the CE Mode. (Refer to [6.4.2.5 NVM Initialize].)
Code;116-334
Description;NVM Data Mismatch The verification result between the On Board NVM and the Backup NVM of the Controller is mismatched. (This includes cases where one of the NVM is Blank)
Remedy;1. Turn the power OFF and ON. 2. Perform NVM Matching (NVM[621-400]) in the CE Mode.
Code;116-377
Description;IIT Interrupt Time out The DMA start trigger when scanning documents cannot be detected for a specified time.
Remedy;1. Turn the power OFF and ON. 2. Turn OFF the power and check the Flat Cable between the IIT Carriage J700 and the ESS/MCU PWB J420 for open circuits, short circuits, and poor contacts (especially, check whether the Flat Cable was inserted in a skewed manner). 3. Check the ESS/MCU PWB for improper installation (loose screw). 4. If no problem is found, replace the ESS/MCU PWB. (PL 18.1)
Code;116-747
Description;Invalid Page Margin During Copy Job, subtracting the amount of edge erase from the section that should have been scanned resulted in a negative value.
Remedy;Change the value for NVM [790-301] (Document Edge Erase Amount) or NVM [790-302] (Document Edge Erase Amount (for ID Card Copy)).
Code;117-326
Description;Controller Backup NVM Data Defect Any of the following was detected: • The Backup NVM data of the Controller is corrupted. • The Backup NVM of the Controller is not installed. • Any one of the Print Counter has reached its maximum value. • The number of times the NVM can be changed has reached its limit.
Remedy;1. Turn the power OFF and ON. 2. Check the EEPROM (Master) on the ESS/MCU PWB for poor contact with the socket. 3. Perform NVM Initialize in the CE Mode. (Refer to [6.4.2.5 NVM Initialize].) 4. If the problem persists, replace the ESS/MCU PWB. (PL 18.1)
Code;123-314
Description;UI Panel Communication Fail Communication failure between the ESS/MCU PWB and the UI Panel was detected.
Remedy;1. Turn the power OFF and ON. 2. Turn OFF the power and check the Flat Cable between the UI PWB J740 and the ESS/ MCU PWB J422 for open circuits, short circuits, and poor contacts. 3. If no problem is found, replace the following parts in sequence: • UI PWB (PL 1.6) • ESS/MCU PWB (PL 18.1)
