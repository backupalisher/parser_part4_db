Check the wire between the PWB Pin 3 and the Motor Pin 2 for an open circuit or poor contact. Replace the PWB.
Code;OF 99-7
Description;2 Wire Motor On
Remedy;Turn the printer power Off. Remove the PWB connector. There is 10 Ohm’s or less measured between the connector Pin 3 and the frame. Y↓N→Replace the PWB. Check the wire between the connector Pin 3 and the motor Pin 2 for a short circuit. If the check is OK, replace the motor.
Code;OF 99-8
Description;Set Gate Solenoid Open
Remedy;There is +24 VDC measured between the Nip/Release Solenoid Pin 1 (+) and GND (-). Y↓N→There is +24 VDC measured between the PWB Pin 5 (+) and GND(-). Y↓N→Check +24 VDC inputs on the PWB. If the check is OK, replace the PWB. Check the wire between the PWB Pin 5 and the Nip/Release Solenoid Pin 1 for an open circuit or poor contact. There is +24 VDC measured between the PWB Pin 4 (+) and GND(-). Y↓N→There is +24 VDC measured between the Nip/Release Solenoid Pin 3 (+) and GND (- ). Y↓N→Replace the Nip/Release Solenoid. Check the wire between the PWB Pin 4 and the Nip/Release Solenoid Pin 3 for an open circuit and poor contact. Follow the following when the release caused a problem. There is +24 VDC measured between the PWB Pin 6 (+) and GND(-). Y↓N→There is +24 VDC measured between the Nip/Release Solenoid Pin 2 (+) and GND (-) Y↓N→Replace the Nip/Release Solenoid. Check the wire between the PWB Pin 6 and the Nip/Release Solenoid Pin 2 for an open circuit or poor contact. Replace the PWB.
Code;OF 99-9
Description;Multiple Wire Motor For use on DC motors that: • have 1 or 2 DC power inputs • are controlled by 2 or more drivers • have no DC COM connections for return power • have no specific feedback circuits
Remedy;Connect black meter lead to ground. Measure voltage at each pin of J2 (example only, refer to the actual Circuit Diagram for the correct voltage and connector designation). +24 VDC is measured at each pin. Y↓N→Disconnect J2. Measure voltage at P2-1 and P2-6 (refer to HVPS, +24V LVPS T10 Plug/Jack Locations ). +24 VDC is measured. Y↓N→Turn the machine Off then On. Measure voltage at P2-1 and P2-6. +24 VDC is measured. Y↓N→If an interlock circuit is present, check the interlock circuit. Repair as required. If the interlock circuit is good, replace the PWB. Check the motor wires for a short circuit. If the wires are good, replace the Motor. Check the motor wires for obvious damage. If the wires are good, replace the Motor. Replace the PWB.
