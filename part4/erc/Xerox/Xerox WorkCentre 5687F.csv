Remedy;•. Check for damage or obstructions that would prevent the tamper assembly from operating correctly. If necessary, install a new tamper assembly, PL 11.16 Item 1. • Jams can be caused by removing prints from bin 1 before the machine has finished printing. If the tampers are touched while they are moving, they may stall and cause the machine to shutdown. The resulting shutdown can cause un-clearable jams in the finisher and the tray 3 and tray 4 to paper path interface. • Jams can also be caused if the tray settings do not match the paper in the trays. Make sure the tray settings are correct. • Check the condition and the tension of the front tamper drive belt. Tensioning is achieved by a spring on the motor, the motor should be free to move. • If there is a large jam of paper above bin 1 that has obstructed the tampers, this has probably been caused by poorly stacked sets failing to actuate the bin 1 upper level sensor. Perform the following: – Check the paper for defects that could degrade the tamping operation e.g. curl, paper condition, buckling or paper type. Refer to IQ1 Image Quality Entry RAP. – Check the operation of the paddle roll, refer to 11-024-110, 11-025-110 Paddle Roll Failure RAP. – Check the operation of the bin 1 upper level sensor, refer to 11-030-110, 11-334-110, 11-335-110, 11-336-110 Bin 1 Movement Failure RAP. – Refer to the 11J-110 Mis-Registration in Stapled Sets and Non-Stapled Sets RAP. – Check the 2K LCSS PWB DIP switch settings, refer to 11F-110 2K LCSS PWB DIP Switch Settings RAP.

NOTE: The away home position is with the rear tamper approximately halfway along it’s travel.
Remedy;•. Check for damage or obstructions that would prevent the tamper assembly from operating correctly. If necessary, install a new tamper assembly, PL 11.16 Item 1. • Jams can be caused by removing prints from bin 1 before the machine has finished printing. If the tampers are touched while they are moving, they may stall and cause the machine to shutdown. The resulting shutdown can cause un-clearable jams in the finisher and the tray 3 and tray 4 to paper path interface. • Jams can also be caused if the tray settings do not match the paper in the trays. Make sure the tray settings are correct. • Check the condition of the front tamper drive belt and that it is correctly tensioned. Tensioning is achieved by a spring on the motor, the motor should be free to move. • If there is a large jam of paper above bin 1 that has obstructed the tampers, this has probably been caused by poorly stacked sets failing to actuate the bin 1 upper level sensor. Perform the following: – Check the paper for defects that could degrade the tamping operation e.g. curl, paper condition, buckling or paper type. Refer to IQ1 Image Quality Entry RAP. – Check the operation of the paddle roll, refer to 11-024-110, 11-025-110 Paddle Roll Failure RAP. – Check the operation of the bin 1 upper level sensor, refer to 11-030-110, 11-334-110, 11-335-110, 11-336-110 Bin 1 Movement Failure RAP. – Refer to the 11J-110 Mis-Registration in Stapled Sets and Non-Stapled Sets RAP. – Check the 2K LCSS PWB DIP switch settings, refer to 11F-110 2K LCSS PWB DIP Switch Settings RAP.

Description;Bin 1 Movement Failure RAP 11-030-110 Bin 1 fails to move. 11-334-110 Bin 1 has reached the upper limit of travel. 11-335-110 Bin 1 has reached the lower limit of travel. 11-336-110 Bin 1 is not at the home position. NOTE: The home position of bin 1 is when bin 1 is actuating the bin 1 lower level sensor. See the final actions at the end of the procedure. Three sensors and two switches monitor the level of paper in bin 1 and the position of the tray: • The bin 1 upper level sensor, the highest of two sensors that detect the top of the paper stack in bin 1, or the empty bin 1. • The bin 1 90% full sensor detects when the tray has descended to a position where the tray is 90% full. • The bin 1 lower level sensor, the lowest of two sensors that detects when paper is removed from bin 1. • Bin 1 upper limit switch, S11-334. • Bin 1 lower limit switch, S11-335.
Remedy;"Perform the following: • Check for a physical obstruction that would prevent bin 1 from moving, such as an item of furniture. • Check that bin 1 is level front to back, if necessary perform ADJ 11.1-110 2K LCSS Bin 1 Level. • Check the 2K LCSS PWB DIP switch settings, refer to 11F-110 2K LCSS PWB DIP Switch Settings RAP. • Refer to the 11J-110 Mis-Registration in Stapled Sets and Non-Stapled Sets RAP. • If there is a large jam of paper above bin 1, this has probably been caused by poorly stacked sets failing to actuate the bin 1 upper level sensor. Perform the relevant check: • If paper is overflowing the tray when it is at the lower limit, check the tray 90% full sensor. • If paper cannot be fed to bin 1 when it is at the highest position, check the bin 1 paper sensor - low and bin 1 paper sensor - high. Check the front and rear bin 1 drive belts. If necessary install new components, PL 11.10 Item 1. NOTE: All 2K LCSS interlocks must be made to supply +24V to the motors. NOTE: In diagnostics, actuating any 2K LCSS sensor or switch can change the displayed state on the UI. Make sure that the correct sensor or switch is tested. Remove the 2K LCSS rear cover.
