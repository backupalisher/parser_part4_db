Description;Ink Level Sense Faults There are two known ways an Ink level sense over-range fault can occur. One fault condition results from an internal short in the sensor or Printhead. In these cases, replacement of the Printhead is required. A more common fault condition is caused by ink contamination. If different color or type of inks mix in the reservoir, the sensor’s function is impaired producing the over range fault. If multiple colors have mixed or the wrong type of ink has been used, remove the source of the ink contamination, and then purge the Printhead. NOTE: The Ink level sensors can detect contamination before color mixing appears on prints. 34,015.48 An over range level sense error occurred in the Cyan Printhead reservoir. Check The Cyan reservoir for contamination. 34,016.40 An over range level sense error occurred in the Magenta Printhead reservoir. Check The Magenta reservoir for contamination. 34,017.41 An over range level sense error occurred in the Yellow Printhead reservoir. Check The Yellow reservoir for contamination. 34,018.42 An over range level sense error occurred in the Black Printhead reservoir. Check The Black reservoir for contamination.

Purge the reservoir using solid color test prints as described. Clear the Ink Loader of Ink. For these types of errors, clear the Ink Loader of the incorrect Ink. 1. Remove the Ink Loader. 2. Load the correct Ink into the chutes. 3. Clean the area surrounding the Printhead reservoir for the affected color(s). 4. Install the Ink Loader. Has all the improper Ink been removed from the Ink Loader and Printhead area? Go to Step 3. Continue cleaning until no residual ink remains in the Ink Loader or area surrounding the Printhead. 3 Disable Ink Loader level sensing. 1. Open the Ink Loader Door. 2. Switch the power On and interrupt the initialization process immediately after the Xerox logo is replaced by the words “Warming Up” by holding down the Up Arrow button while pressing the OK button. If successful, the words “Level sense disabled” momentarily appear on the display. If these words don’t appear, power Off the system and attempt the procedure again. Ink level sensing remains disabled for approximately 5 minutes. Is level sense disabled? Go to Step 4. Continue Step 3 until level sensing is disabled. 4 Close the Ink Loader Door and allow the system to reach “Ready”. Is the system Ready? Go to Step 5. Go to Step 7. 5 Access the Service Tools menu to purge the Printhead contamination using the Ink Flush Prints routine. Select the affected color to print 20 solid fill prints. Were 20 solid fills printed? Go to Step 6. Continue printing solid fills in the affected color(s). 6 Check that the contamination has been purged. 1. Shutdown the system. 2. Turn the system On. Did the system reach “Ready” without error? Complete. Go to Step 2 and attempt a second purge procedure. If unsuccessful, go to Step 7. 7 Replace the Printhead. Does the error persist? Replace the Electronics Module. Complete
