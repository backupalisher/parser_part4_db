Description;The machine is not working (1) 1. Ensure that the customer knows how to install the correct printer driver and to select the WorkCentre 3119 as the default printer. 2. Perform the pattern test, GP 5. 3. Check that the PC and the machine are properly connected and that the toner cartridge is installed correctly. 4. Printing is not working in Windows. 5. Check that the printer cable is directly connected to the machine.
Remedy;1. Refer the customer to the User Guide. 2. If the test print works that means there are no problems in the machine. If the test printing does not work, the machine is faulty and the problem is not due to computer software or driver settings. 3. Install a new printer cable. If the problem still persists, check the amount of the remaining toner (refer to GP 7). 4. Check if the connection between PC and printer port is correct. Uninstall the driver, then re-install new drivers. Refer to Xerox.com. Ask the customer to check the BIOS of the PC to ensure that there are no IRQ conflicts and to check that the input/output range is 0378. 5. If you have other devices that need to share the printer port, try temporarily disconnecting these devices and perhaps even uninstalling their drivers to ensure the machine works by itself. If you are using a USB hub try connecting directly to the back of the PC instead.

Display;-
Description;The machine is not working (2) After receiving the print command there is no response at all or print speed is low due to wrong setup of the environment rather than malfunction of the machine itself. 1. Ensure that the customer knows how to install the correct printer driver and to select the WorkCentre 3119 as the default printer. 2. Ensure you have sufficient free hard disk space for the temporary work files created during printing. 3. Printing error occurs even if there is enough space in the hard disk. 4. Reboot the system to print.
Remedy;1. Refer the customer to the WorkCentre 3119 User Guide. 2. The message `insufficient printer memory` means there is a hard disk space problem on the PC, rather than a printer RAM problem. Inform the customer. 3. The connection of the cable and printer port is not correct. Check that the cable is properly connected. Ask the customer to check the BIOS of the PC to ensure that there are no IRQ conflicts and to check that the input/output range is 0378. 4. If the regular font is not printing, the cable or the printer driver may be defective. Turn the PC and machine off, and reboot the system to print again. If not solved, double-click the printer in My Computer. If the regular fonts are not printed this time the cable must be defective. Install a new cable.

Description;Abnormal Printing. Printing does not work – even after replacing the cable Machine does not work at all or strange fonts are printed. 1. Printer Driver Error. 2. Error message “insufficient memory”. (The printing job sometimes stops due to insufficient virtual memory, this is caused by insufficient space on the PC hard disk.)
Remedy;1. Ensure that the correct driver is loaded. Use the driver supplied on the CD or downloaded from the Xerox.com. DO NOT use the Microsoft driver supplied with the Windows operating system. If the machine is a GDI printer ensure that ALL OTHER GDI drivers are un-installed as Windows allows only 1 type of driver to be loaded. 2. Inform the customer.
