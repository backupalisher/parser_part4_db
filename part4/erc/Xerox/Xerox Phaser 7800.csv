Description;Belt Home Fail Too Long. 1. The engine senses that the IBT Belt Drive Motor is not turning. 2. Or, the MOB Sensor does not see RegiCon chevrons on the IBT Belt.
Remedy;1. Perform the following steps: • Check the IBT Belt Cleaner blade. If the blade is not adequately lubricated it can cause drag on the IBT Belt. The blade edge can be lubricated with waste toner from the Belt Cleaner assembly. • Check the IBT Belt Unit for mechanical loading and damage. • Perform the IBT Belt Motor test in Diagnostics. • If the belt is turning, perform a stall test while the printer is initializing and see if the RegiCon chevrons are printing on the belt. If the chevrons are printing and the IBT belt is moving. Examine the MOB Sensor for obstructions. • If the IBT Belt does not turn when the IBT Belt Motor test is performed in diagnostics, remove the IBT Belt Assembly and run the IBT Belt Motor test again in diagnostics. If the Motor does not turn, replace the following parts in sequence: – IBT Drive Motor Assembly – Motor Drive PWB • If the IBT Belt Motor runs when the IBT Belt Motor test is performed in diagnostics with the IBT Belt Assembly removed, diagnose and repair condition causing the belt assembly to bind. • Test the MOB shutter open/closed in diagnostics. If the shutter open/ closed test fails, replace the MOB ADC Assembly. NOTE: A temporary repair to allow the customer to use the printer if a MOB Sensor is not available and the shutter is not functioning correctly, is to remove the shutter from the MOB Assembly until a replacement assembly can be installed. 2. If no problems are found, replace the following parts in sequence: • IBT Belt Unit • MCU PWB
