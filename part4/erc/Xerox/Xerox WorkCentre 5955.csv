Description;Poor Stacking RAP Use this RAP to find the cause of poor stacking in the LVF BM.
Remedy;"Check the items that follow; • Look for sets that are not dropping back fully in bin 1 and therefore not operating the bin 1 level sensors: – Large paper sizes should not be stacked on top of small paper sizes. – Ensure that the paper stack in each paper tray has been fanned. – Turn over the paper stack in each paper tray. – Ensure that all paper or other copy stock being used is within the size and weight specifications. Refer to GP 20 Paper and Media Size Specifications. – Use a new ream of paper, if available. – Ensure that the edge guides of all paper trays are adjusted correctly for the paper size and that the trays are fully closed. – Check that bin 1 is seated correctly and the bin 1 alignment clip is in position, PL 12.320 Item 12. • Labels must not be fed to bin 1, but to bin 0 only. • It is recommended that transparencies are fed to bin 0 whenever possible. • Check that bin 1 is level front to back. If necessary perform ADJ 12.1-150 LVF BM Bin 1 Level. • Check that the bin 1 upper level sensor, Q12-188 is working correctly. Refer to the 312- 462-00-150 LVF BM Bin 1 Movement Failure RAP. • Check the operation of the front and rear tampers. Refer to the 312-392-00-150, 312-393- 00-150, 312-394-00-150 LVF BM Front Tamper Move Failure RAP and 312-396-00-150, 312-397-00-150, 312-398-00-150 LVF BM Rear Tamper Move Failure RAP. • Check that the LVF BM is not near an air conditioning or ventilation output duct. Air flow across the output bins can cause poor stacking. • Check the output copies/prints for curl. Refer to the IQ5 Print Damage RAP."

Description;Mis-Registration in Stapled Sets and Non- Stapled Sets RAP Use this RAP to identify and correct the causes of mis-registration in stapled sets, resulting in staples missing some sheets in the set, or poorly registered non-stapled sets.
Remedy;The most likely cause of mis-registration is paper condition and/or damage such as curl, wrinkle, creases, dog ears, etc. Curl, wrinkle and creases are probably caused in the IOT. Go to IQ1 Image Quality Entry RAP. For other copy/print damage and dog ears, go to the 312H-150 Copy Damage in the LVF BM RAP. Perform the steps that follow: • Check that bin 1 is seated correctly and the bin 1 alignment clip is in position, PL 12.320 Item 12. • Turn over the paper stack in the tray in use. • Use a new ream of paper in the tray in use. • Paper type especially recycled paper can lead to registration problems. Change to a different brand or type of paper, if available. • Ensure that the guides in the paper trays are correctly set and reported on the UI for the paper size loaded. • Check that paper type is set correctly. If heavyweight paper is used but not set in the UI, the compiler capacity can be exceeded. • Check for obstructions in the compiler. • Ensure that the paddle roll operates correctly and that the paddles are not damaged. The paddles should park completely inside the top section of the compiler, with the shorter paddle in a vertical position. If all of the paddles are out of position, check the paddle roll home sensor, PL 12.335 Item 4, the flag, PL 12.335 Item 7 and the paddle motor assembly, PL 12.335 Item 10. If only 1 paddle is mis-aligned with the others, it can be re-positioned by hand (they are not bonded to the shaft). If necessary install new paddles, PL 12.335 Item 3. • Ensure that the paddles are clean. If necessary, use formula A cleaning fluid, PL 26.10 Item 2 to clean the paddles. • Ensure that the tampers operate correctly, i.e. are not stalling or losing position during the job. Inspect the tampers for damage, if necessary install new components. PL 12.355. • Inspect the bin 1 entry nips for roll damage. The idlers should be held against the rubber driving rolls and they should be free to rotate within their support springs. If necessary, install new components, PL 12.375. • Inspect the 4 spring loaded guides on the output cover, PL 12.335 Item 9. Ensure that they are correctly located and are free to move up and down.

Description;Copy Damage in the LVF BM RAP Use this RAP to identify and correct the causes of copy damage in the LVF BM.
Remedy;Perform the steps that follow: • Look for torn paper in the LVF BM paper path. Torn fragments can pass through the IOT and LVF BM paper path without causing a problem until they finally wedge themselves at some point. A likely place for a piece of paper to be wedged is at the hole punch assembly, where the top and bottom guides form the narrowest part of the paper path. • Ensure that the exit diverter gate assembly, PL 12.370 Item 13, operates correctly and has full movement. • Ensure that the hole punches park at the fully open position. If they protrude even slightly, a jam will occur in the narrow paper path of the hole punch. • Ensure that the paper entry guide assembly, PL 12.350 Item 7, closes and latches correctly. Check that the magnet at the rear is located and operates correctly. Check the clip at the front is positioned correctly. • Ensure that all idler rolls in the LVF BM paper path are free to rotate, particularly those on the jam clearance guide, where the paper turns through 90 degrees. • Ensure that the paper path ribs of the paper entry guide assembly, PL 12.350 Item 7, and the entry guide cover assembly, PL 12.320 Item 3, are free of “scores” and “nicks”. Check also for contamination and glue from label stock.

Remedy;• Check that the paper loaded in the paper trays matches the paper size displayed on the UI. Refer to 371-500-00 Tray 1 Open During Run RAP and 372-500-00 Tray 2 Open During Run RAP. • Ensure that the paper being fed to the BM conforms to the specification, GP 20 Paper and Media Size Specification. • Ensure that the booklets being produced do not exceed the maximum contents given in Table1.

Description;Tray 3 False Low Paper Level RAP Use this RAP when the machine displays ‘tray 3 is low on paper’ when the tray is full. The ‘tray is low on paper’ message should appear when the tray is at 10% of its capacity. The machine measures the time taken for the tray to elevate after being closed, to determine the amount of paper remaining in tray 3. This measurement only occurs if the tray has been open for a minimum of 30 seconds. If the tray is closed within 30 seconds the timeout of the last known paper level is used and no new timing is calculated. NOTE: A low paper condition will be declared if the stack is below approximately 190 sheets.
