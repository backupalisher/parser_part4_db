Remedy;Electric continuity 1 Using a multi-meter check the electric continuity between TB_SEP (on PW13556_02) and GND. Is there an electric continuity? Yes As the high voltage seems to be leaking, check the harness, Separation Discharge Needles, and concerning parts and find the point of leaking, No Go to 2. TB_SEP connector 2 Turn off the printer, plug out the TB_SEP connector on the PW13556_02, and turn the printer back on. Does the E-0735 error appear again? Yes If the E-0735 error still appears, go to 3. No In case the E-0735 error does not appear but any other high voltage error appears, go to the troubleshooting section of indicated error. PW15556_02 Secondary Transfer PCB Assy 3 Does the error disappears if you replace the PW15556_02 PCB with another one? Yes OK No Go to 4. Other factors 4 If the E-0735 error still appears, plug out the connector TB_SEP (on PW13556_02), and print out the test pattern No.18 from the Maintenance GUI. Does the printout have any abnormal image? Yes Any high voltage has some abnormality such as leaking and causing the abnormal image. Check all high voltage items and find the abnormality. No Check the Separation Discharge Needle as it may be having some abnormality such as deformation and etc. Also please try to replace the Separation Discharge Needle with another one. And just in case, check the HV harness to the Separation Discharge Needle.
