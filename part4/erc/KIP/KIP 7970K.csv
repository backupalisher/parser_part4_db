(Signal Code: 000ch) Is the status “H” when the Separation Sensor does not detect the paper? And is it “L” when the Separation Sensor detects the paper? NOTE Refer to [8.6 Input Check]. No 1. Check the wire of Separation Sensor. 2. If the wire has no problem, replace the Separation Sensor with the new one. Tr / Sep Corona 3 Is the Corona Head set? No Set the Corona Head properly. Is the Corona wire broken? Yes Replace the Corona wire. High Voltage Power Supply 4 Is the High Voltage (HV3) applied properly? No Replace HV Power Supply.
Code;J-01000000
Description;Fuser unit Jam
Causes;The Paper Exit Sensor Signal (P_EXIT) does not change from H to L within a specified time since the machine has restarted feeding the paper from the paper stop position during printing.
Remedy;Jam 1 Did a jam occur between Separation Area and Exit Area? Yes Remove the paper. Paper Exit Sensor (PH8) 2 Check the status of Paper Exit Sensor (P_EXIT) in Input Check. (Signal Code: 000dh) Is the status “H” when the Paper Exit Sensor does not detect the paper? And is it “L” when the Paper Exit Sensor detects the paper? NOTE Refer to [8.6 Input Check]. No 1. Check the wire of Paper Exit Sensor. 2. If the wire has no problem, replace the Paper Exit Sensor with the new one.
Code;J-04000000
Description;Exit Part (Top) Jam
Causes;In case the Paper Exit Unit for front stacking is connected, Front Stack Jam Sensor (STACKJ_S) does not generate a clock signal (H & L alternately) during the time that the media should be running that area.
Remedy;Jam 1 Did a jam occur at Exit Area in case Paper Exit Unit for Front Stacking was connected? Yes Remove the paper. Front Stack Jam Sensor (PH15) 2 Check the status of Front Stack Jam Sensor (STACKJ_S) using Input Check. (Signal Code: 0018h) Does the signal change “L” and “H” alternately, while Printed Sheet is fed? NOTE Refer to [8.6 Input Check]. No 1. Check the wire of Front Stack Jam Sensor. 2. If the wire has no problem, replace the Front Stack Jam Sensor.
Code;J-08000000
Description;Exit Part (Rear) Jam
Causes;1. The Paper Exit Sensor Signal (P_EXIT) is L at the time you turn on the machine. 2. The Paper Exit Sensor Signal (P_EXIT) once changes from H to L during printing. But after that it does not change from L to H within a specified time since the Paper Gate Sensor Signal (P_GATE) has changed from L to H.
Remedy;Jam 1 Did a jam occur at the Exit Area? Yes Remove the paper. Paper Exit Sensor (PH8) 2 Check the status of Paper Exit Sensor (P_EXIT) in Input Check. (Signal Code: 000dh) Is the status “H” when the Paper Exit Sensor does not detect the paper? And is it “L” when the Paper Exit Sensor detects the paper? NOTE Refer to [8.6 Input Check]. No 1. Check the wire of Paper Exit Sensor. 2. If the wire has no problem, replace the Paper Exit Sensor with the new one.
Code;J-10000000
Description;Stacker Jam
Causes;1. After the Paper reached to the Exit Sensor, “Paper Existence Status” is not received from Outer Device (Auto Stacker, Folder, etc.) within specified time. 2. After the Paper left the Exit Sensor, “No Paper Status” is not received from Outer Device (Auto Stacker, Folder, etc.) within specified time.
Remedy;Jam 1 Did a jam occur between Outer Device (Auto Stacker, Folder, etc) and Exit Area? Yes 1. Remove the paper. 2. Adjust the height of the Outer Device. Transmission PCB (PW5490) Reception PCB (PW5491) 2 Try to replace each Transmission PCB and Reception PCB. Can you fix the problem? No 1. Check the wire of Transmission / Reception PCB. 2. Replace PW13720 PCB with new one.
