Code;U6-09
Description;LCC lift motor trouble • The upper limit sensor is not turned on within 24sec from starting the liftup motor. • The encoder input is not made within 0.2sec during rotation of the liftup motor. The upper limit SW is turned on during rotation of the liftup motor. When the above trouble occurs for 3 times continuously. • For the first time and the second time, it is a tray size error and the user pulls the tray. When the trouble occurs 3 time continuously that the upper limit sensor does not turn on.
Causes;Sensor trouble LCC control PWB trouble. Gear breakage. Lift motor trouble.
Remedy;Use SIM to check the sensor detection. Use SIM to check the lift motor operation. Use SIM 15 to cancel the trouble.
Code;U6-20
Description;LCC communication trouble Communication trouble with the LCC. Follows the communication protocol specifications. Communication error, timing abnormality of the communication data and the communication signal line
Causes;Improper connection or disconnection of the connector and the harness. Desk control PWB trouble Control PWB (PCU) trouble. Malfunction caused by noises
Remedy;Canceled by turning ON/OFF the power. Check the connector and the harness in the communication line.
Code;U6-21
Description;LCC transport motor trouble The lock detection signal is detected continuously for 1sec after delay of 1sec from start of the motor. When the motor lock detection signal is continued for 1sec after 1sec delay from starting the motor. For the first time, it is regarded as a Jam and the machine is stopped. When two errors are continued, it is regarded as a trouble.
Causes;Motor lock Motor RPM abnormality Overcurrent to the motor Desk control PWB trouble
Remedy;Use SIM 4-3 to check the transport motor operation.
Code;U6-22
