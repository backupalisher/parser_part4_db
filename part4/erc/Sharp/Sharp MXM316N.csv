Causes;HDD trouble*1 MFPC PWB trouble Strong external noises.
Remedy;Check the data related to the check sum error (address book, image send system registration data (senders record, meta data)) and register again. Use SIM16 to cancel the U2 trouble. Replace the HDD*1. Replace the MFPC PWB. (Refer to the pages on the necessary works after replacing the HDD and the MFPC PWB in the Service Manual, and perform the works.)*1
Code;U2-60
Description;Watermark check error
Causes;Watermark data trouble HDD trouble MFPC PWB trouble
Remedy;Use SIM16 to cancel the U2 trouble. Use SIM49-5 to install the watermark data. Replace the HDD. Replace the MFPC PWB. (Refer to the pages on the necessary works after replacing the HDD and the MFPC PWB in the Service Manual, and perform the works.)
Code;U2-80
Description;SCU PWB EEPROM read/write error
Causes;SCU PWB EEPROM trouble SCU PWB trouble SCU PWB EEPROM socket connection trouble
Remedy;Replace the SCU PWB EEPROM. Replace the SCU PWB. Check connection of the SCU PWB EEPROM socket. Check the SIM adjustment value of the following items, and adjust again if they are improper. * Scanner-related adjustments * Touch panel-related adjustments Use SIM16 to cancel the trouble. To avoid missing of the counter data and the adjustment values, use this simulation to save the counter data and the adjustment values. (If there is a printer option, use SIM22-01 to save the counter data and the adjustment values.)
Code;U2-81
Description;SCU PWB EEPROM check sum error
Causes;SCU PWB EEPROM trouble. Installation of non-initialized EEPROM. SCU PWB trouble. EEPROM socket contact trouble
Remedy;Replace the SCU PWB EEPROM. Replace the SCU PWB. Check contact of the EEPROM socket. Use SIM16 to cancel the trouble. (The check sum error detection data are calculated again to reset the proper check sum data.) To avoid missing of the counter data and the adjustment values, use this simulation to save the counter data and the adjustment values. (If there is a printer option, use SIM22-01 to save the counter data and the adjustment values.)
Code;U2-90
Description;PCU PWB EEPROM read/write error
Causes;PCU PWB EEPROM trouble PCU PWB trouble EEPROM socket contact trouble
Remedy;Replace the PCU PWB EEPROM. Check the SIM adjustment values of the engine, and adjust again if they are improper. Replace the PCU PWB. Check contact of the EEPROM socket. Use SIM16 to cancel the trouble. To avoid missing of the counter data and the adjustment values, use this simulation to save the counter data and the adjustment values. (If there is a printer option, use SIM22-01 to save the counter data and the adjustment values.)
Code;U2-91
Description;PCU PWB EEPROM check sum error
Causes;PCU PWB EEPROM trouble PCU PWB trouble EEPROM socket contact trouble
Remedy;Replace the PCU PWB EEPROM. Replace the PCU PWB. Check contact of the EEPROM socket. Use SIM16 to cancel the trouble. (The check sum error detection data are calculated again to reset the proper check sum data.) To avoid missing of the counter data and the adjustment values, use this simulation to save the counter data and the adjustment values.
