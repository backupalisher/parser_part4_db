Code;E7 01
Description;Duplex model memory setup error, memory notdetected error
Causes;The memory is not set properly or the memory capacity is not set to the duplex setup (6M). Cancel method: Set SIM 26-39 code number to 2.
Code;E7 02
Description;HSYNC not detected.
Causes;LSU (laser diode, reception element, APC circuit) trouble LSU drive circuit (ASIC) trouble
Code;E7 10
Description;CCD black level trouble
Causes;CCD drive circuit (CCD PWB, ASIC, harness) trouble
Code;E7 11
Description;CCD white level trouble
Causes;CCD drive circuit (CCD PWB, ASIC harness) trouble Copy lamp lighting trouble (Copy lamp, inverter PWB)
Code;E7 12
Description;Shading trouble (White correction)
Causes;Dirt on white plate for scanning white level
Code;E7 16
Description;Laser output trouble
Causes;LSU (laser diode, reception element, APC circuit) trouble LSU drive circuit (ASIC) trouble
Code;F2 04
Description;Toner cartridge error
Causes;
Code;F5 02
Description;Copy lamp disconnection trouble
Causes;Copy lamp or copy lamp drive circuit (inverter PWB) trouble Copy lamp disconnection
Code;H2 00
Description;Thermistor open detection
Causes;The fusing thermistor is open.
Code;H3 00
Description;Heat roller abnormally high temperature
Causes;The fusing temperature rises above 240° C.
Code;H4 00
Description;Heat roller abnormally low temperature
Causes;The fusing temperature does not reach 185° C within 27 sec of turning on the power, or the fusing temperature keeps at 140° C.
Code;L1 00
Description;Feeding is not completed within the specified time after starting feeding. (The scan head locking switch is locked)
Causes;The white area and the black marking on the shading plate are used to obtain the difference in the CCD level values for judgment of lock. When the difference in the levels of which and black is small, it is judged that the black mark could not be scanned by lock and the trouble code “L1” is displayed.
Code;L3 00
Description;Return is not completed within the specified time.
Causes;When the mirror base is returned for the specified time (6 sec) in mirror initializing after turning on the power, the mirror home position sensor (MHPS) does not turn ON. Or when the mirror base is returned for the specified time (about 6 sec) after start of copy return, the mirror home position sensor (MHPS) does not turn ON.
Code;L4 01
Description;Main motor lock
Causes;When the main motor encoder pulse is not detected for 100 msec.
Code;L6 10
Description;Polygon motor lock
Causes;The lock signal (specified rpm signal) does not return within a certain time (about 20 sec) from starting the polygon motor rotation
Code;U2 01
Description;Counter sum check error
Causes;When the counter check sum value stored in the EEPROM is abnormal.
Code;U2 04
Description;EEPROM serial communication error
Causes;When a communication trouble occurs with the EEPROM.
Code;U2 40
Description;Main IC chip read error
Causes;When a communication trouble occurs with the EEPROM.
