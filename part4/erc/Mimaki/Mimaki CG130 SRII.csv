Set the number of registration marks to be detected to a number equal to or smaller than that of the printed registration marks. The shape of the printed registration marks and the shape of set registration marks do not agree with each other. Correct the shape setting of registration marks so that it agrees with the shape of the printed registration marks. The size of the printed registration marks and the size of set registration marks differ from each other substantially. Measure the size of printed registration marks and set the measured value as the registration mark size. Scale compensation was performed by “BEFORE” setting but the input value does not agree with the distance between the printed registration marks.

Display;ERR 36 MARKdetect
Description;Phenomenon: Sensor is not able to detect Mark. (The printed registration marks are inappropriate.)
Remedy;Registration marks are printed in some color other than black. Use Black ink as far as possible since non-black colors may be undetected. The line is too thin (less than 0.3 mm), too thick (over 1.0 mm) or smeared. Or, thicker due to blurring. Select the line width within the proper range (0.3 mm to 1.0 mm) as far as possible since others than the proper widths may be undetected. Do not use an easily blurred sheet. Printed registration marks are blurred. Reprint, if necessary, since significantly blurred registration marks cannot be detected. The distance between registration marks is too short (less than 50 mm) or too long (9000 mm or more). Reprint so that the distance between registration marks is within the allowable range. The registration mark size is too small for the distance between the registration marks. When the distance between registration marks is large, small registration marks may not be recognized if the sheet is skewed. Enlarge the registration mark size to prevent this problem. (Select appropriate values based on the example given in the Operation Manual.) Smears, print data or outer frames are found near registration marks. It is unable to detect if there are any prints or smears other than the mark within a square area being twice the mark size from the mark corner as the center. Correct or reprint it. Registration marks are printed outside the moveable range. Reset the sheet, or use Expand Mode so that the marks are located inside the movable area. Printed data or smears were found between registration marks when the setting for DIST.REVI was “AFTER”. Detect in “BEFORE”, or turn DIST.REVI to OFF if “FineCut” is used.

Display;ERR 60 PenEncoder
Description;Pen height undetectable
Remedy;1. Execute the sensor testing, and check if the value on LCD varies when the penholder is moved up and down by hand. 2. Check the connector and cable connections and no disconnection. 3. Replace the Pen encoder. 4. Replace the Main PCB.
Code;61
Display;ERR 61 Pen Stroke
Description;Incorrect pen height Unless 2.5 ~ 3.5 mm, normal cutting impossible.
Remedy;1. Check no foreign matters stuck to the Pen line rubber. 2. When a penholder available on the market is used, use the pen cap and assemble it with the cap at the proper position. 3. When the pen cannot down surely due to sheet floating, set the sheet again with using the hold function. 4. Check no worn, no floating and no deformed on the Pen line rubber, or replace it. 5. Check the head height then adjust it. 6. If any trouble occurs in the head up/down motion, adjust or replace it. 7. Replace the Y-bar if any extreme torsion, distortion or deformation occurs on the Y-bar.
Code;n01
Display;illegal ipt ***
Description;Abnormal interruption The firmware does not function due to an abnormal interruption.
Remedy;No error message displayed nor started. Replace Main PCB due to the PCB defect. Error message displayed and function stopped (no repeatability) Replace Main PCB since the possibility of PCB defect is assumable highly. Occurrence repeatable, such as at particular operations, or particular data cut. 1. Upgrade to the latest F/W version. 2. Replace the Main PCB.
Code;n02
Display;** OFFSCALE **
Description;Instruction to move to the outside of the plotting area The sheet is too small for the cutting data.
Remedy;Use a sheet that is large enough for the cutting data.
Code;n03
Display;** OFFSCALE **
Description;Instruction to move to the outside of the plotting area The cutting area is set improperly.
Remedy;Correct the cutting area setting.
Code;n04
Display;** OFFSCALE **
Description;Instruction to move to the outside of the plotting area Incorrect settings
Remedy;ORGN SELECT setting does not match the data. Switch to LOWERrightORIGIN or CENTER ORIGIN so that it match the data. ROTATION setting does not match the data. Enable or disable Rotation so that it match the data. Expand-based data was cut without the Expand function turned ON. Set Expand to ON.
Code;n05
Display;** OFFSCALE **
Description;Instruction to move to the outside of the plotting area Moving to the outside of the cutting area was instructed as a result of various compensation settings (for example, distance compensation or axis compensation)
Remedy;1. On the assumption that compensation will be made, select an appropriate sheet size and create data with the origin selected at an appropriate location. 2. Do not fill the cutting area with data up to the boarders when axial compensation is to be made for registration mark detection or for any other purpose.
Code;n06
Display;** NO SHEET **
Description;The sheet having been set is a transparent sheet or a sheet with black backing, which the sheet sensor does not react to.
Remedy;Set the sheet sensor to OFF. Perform sheet width detection only and manually set the cutting area.
Code;n07
Display;** NO SHEET **
Description;Defective sheet sensor
Remedy;If the error is still displayed even after the sheet setting, execute the sensor testing and check the responsibility of sheet sensor. In case of no response, check the connection of sheet sensor then replace it.
Code;n08
Display;*SHEET sensor OFF*
Description;Sheet sensor is disabled This message appears momentarily during sheet detection with the sheet sensor set to OFF.
Remedy;1. When the sheet detection is performed on detectable sheets, lift the lever up and set the sheet sensor to OFF. 2. When the sheet detection only for the width detection is allowable in keeping the sheet sensor to OFF, no action is required. (in this case, the width detection is only executed.)
Code;n09
Display;PRMchk NG RETRY!
Description;Hash check error at startup The hash check of saved parameters failed at startup. Parameter other than system parameters: Initialize the relevant parameter, and perform hash check again. System parameter: Replace the parameters with the backed up parameters, and perform hash check again.
Remedy;It is no problem if displayed temporally then started without any error. However, check each parameter (Settings/Communication/ Pen/Distance compensation/System) since a part or all of the parameters may be back to the initial values. If displayed whenever the power is turned on, the flash ROM is considered to be defective. Check according to the following procedure. 1. Update the F/W to the latest version. 2. Execute the ROM/ RAM Check 3. Clear all parameters. 4. Replace the Main PCB.
Code;n10
Display;MEDIA SKEW <ENT>
Description;The sheet meandered The amount of sheet skew exceeded the skew check setting value when SKEW CHECK was set to ON by the registration mark setting function. The message suggests that the sheet should be reset.
Remedy;Raise the lever, reset the sheet straight and press the [ENTER] key. Adjust the LED pointer to the mark detection start point as the LED pointer lights up and the step feeding is enabled with the Jog key. Press the [ENTER] key to resume registration mark detection.
Code;n11
Display;COPY SKIP
Description;Registration mark detection failed Registration mark detection failed during registration mark detection and continuous copy operation. CG-SRII places priority on continuous operation and, therefore, does not display an error even when registration mark detection fails during copy operation. It simply skips one pattern and enters registration mark detection of the next pattern.
Remedy;This error message appears only momentarily when one pattern is skipped. Therefore, no corrective action is needed. If skip occurs frequently, however, verify the registration mark detection operation as described at “ERR36 MARKdetect”.
