Code;36
Display;ERR 36 MARKdetect
Description;Registration mark detection by sensors failed
Causes;
Remedy;Operation procedure is not proper. 1) Sheet set position was found incorrect in full-auto detection. 2) The LED pointer position was found incorrect in semi-auto detection. 1) Position the sheet correctly in reference to the Operation Manual. 2) Move the pointer to appropriate place according to the registration mark setting in reference to the Operation Manual, and perform detection again. Settings of operation are not proper. 1) The number of printed registration marks and the number of set registration marks do not match. 2) The shape of the printed registration marks and the shape of set registration marks do not match. 3) The size of the printed registration marks and the size of set registration marks differ substantially. 4) Scale compensation was performed according to previous setting but the value does not match the distance between the printed registration marks. 1) Set the number of registration marks to be detected to a smaller number than that of the printed registration marks. 2) Match the shape setting of registration marks to that of the printed registration marks. 3) Measure the size of registration marks and set the registration mark size accordingly. 4) Measure the distance between the printed registration marks accurately and enter that value, or use the postmeasurement setting. (Set scale compensation to OFF if fine cut is to be used.) The printed registration marks are inappropriate. 1) Registration marks are printed in colors other than black. 2) The line is too thin (less than 0.3mm), too thick (over 0.5mm) or smeared. 3) The printed registration marks are blurred. 4) The distance between registration marks is too short (less than 50mm) or too long (over 9000mm). 5) The registration mark size is too small for the distance between the registration marks. 6) Smears, print data or outer frames are found near registration marks. 7) Registration marks are printed outside of the moveable range. 8) Printed data or smears are found between registration marks when DIST.REVI is set to AFTER. 1) Use black ink whenever possible as non-black colors may go undetected. 2) Select a line width within the allowable range (0.3mm to 0.5mm) whenever possible and refrain from using easily bendable sheet. 3) Reprint, if necessary, as blurred registration marks are undetectable. 4) Reprint so that the appropriate distance is maintained between registration marks. 5) When the distance between registration marks is large, small registration marks may go unrecognized because of possible displacement due to a sheet slant, etc. Increase the registration mark size to prevent this problem. (Follow suggested values in the Operation Manual.) 6) Detection may fail if there are printed images or smears other than the registration marks within the square, twice the size of the registration mark, around the corner of a registration mark. If necessary, correct or reprint. 7) Reset the sheet, or move the marks to inside of the moveable area using Expand Mode. 8) Detect in BEFORE or, if using Fine Cut, set DIST.REVI to OFF. The printer sheet is inappropriate. 1) The sheet color is not white. 2) The sheet material is heavy and slippery. 3) The back of the sheet is slippery. 4) The sheet is soft and bends easily. 5) The leading edge of the sheet is touching the floor and the sheet is floating during the registration mark detection. 1) Non-white sheets may go undetected. Use white sheets whenever possible. 2) Set the sheet type to HEAVY and reduce the SPD LIMIT of registration mark setting to around 20cm/s or less. 3) Set the sheet type to HEAVY and reduce the SPD LIMIT of registration mark setting to around 20cm/s or less. 4) Set the sheet type to HEAVY and reduce the SPD LIMIT of registration mark setting to around 20cm/s or less, and use all pinch rollers without using the paper hold. 5) Use paper hold, all pinch rollers, and the sheet basket. Incorrect operations 1) Only two pinch rollers are used when printing on wide sheets. 2) Pinch rollers are used in Low Mode when printing on relatively heavy sheets. 3) The detect-start registration mark is set to the front right while sheets are set in Front Set. 4) The paper hold is not being used while the sheet is clearly floating. Incorrect adjustments 1) SENSOR OFS adjustment is not accurate. 2) Photo sensor sensitivity of the Mark PCB M assembly is not adjusted correctly. 1) Increase the number of pinch rollers according to the sheet width. 2) Use the end pinch rollers in High Mode and, if necessary, increase the inner pinch roller pressure as well. 3) In front setting, the coordinates are turned 180 degrees. Print in such a way that the rear left registration mark is detected first. 4) Use the paper hold whenever possible. 1) Adjust SENSR OFS in reference to the Operation Manual. 2) Adjust sensitivity in reference to the Maintenance Manual. Malfunction in the hard ware. 1) LED got not light up. 1) Check the equipment for broken wires and malfunction of the mark PCB M assembly. If necessary, replace the cable and/or the PCB M assembly. Mechanical trouble 1) Drive fails because of the loose connections in the power transmission components of the drive line (screws, belts, belt tooth jumping, etc.). 1) Check the mechanism for loose pulley screws, belt tension and belt tooth jumping. Adjust or replace components as needed.

Description;Registration mark detection failure Erroneous recognition of registration marks in adjacent patterns
Causes;
Remedy;A larger number of copies was chosen than the number of actually printed graphic patterns. As a result, registration mark detection was attempted after all copies were printed. 1. Operation has ended normally. Press the END key to end Copy Mode. Registration mark detection failed for six or more patterns in a row during continuous copy operation while performing registration mark detection. The light pointer lights up and the light point is indicating the detect-start position. 1) The number of printed registration marks and the number of registration marks specified by a command do not match. 2) The printed registration marks are blurred. 3) Smears, print data or outer frames are found near registration marks. 4) Registration marks are printed outside of the moveable range. 5) The sheet material is heavy and slippery. 6) The back of the sheet is slippery. 7) The sheet is soft and bends easily. 8) The leading edge of the sheet is touching the floor and the sheet is floating during the registration mark detection. 9) Only two pinch rollers are used when printing on wide sheets. 10) Pinch rollers are used in Low Mode when printing on relatively heavy sheets. 11) The registration mark size is too small for the distance between the registration marks. 12) The gap is too short between the adjacent registration marks that belong to different patterns resulting in the same condition as in 3) above. Press the ENTER HOLD key to perform detection again, and press the END key to end the operation. The detect-start position can be fine-adjusted in steps using the jog keys. 1) Stop detection with the END key. Specify the number of registration marks to be detected to the number of the printer registration marks or less. 2) Heavily blurred registration marks are undetectable. Stop detection and reprint. If time is critical, the blur may be repaired with an ink pen or other tools and detection may be performed again (the cutting accuracy may be reduced). 3) Detection may fail if there are printed images or smears other than the registration marks within the square, twice the size of the registration mark, around the corner of a registration mark. If necessary, repair with a correcting ink (the cutting accuracy may be reduced) or stop detection with the END key and reprint. 4) Stop detection with the END key, and reset the sheet, or decrease the number of width-wise copies and retry. 5) Stop detection with the END key. Set the sheet type to HEAVY and reduce the SPD LIMIT of registration mark setting to around 20cm/s or less. 6) Stop detection with the END key. Set the sheet type to HEAVY and reduce the SPD LIMIT of registration mark setting to around 20cm/s or less. 7) Stop detection with the END key. Set the sheet type to HEAVY and reduce the SPD LIMIT of registration mark setting to around 20cm/s or less. At the same time, set the paper hold to OFF and use all pinch rollers. 8) Stop detection with the END key. Retry using the paper hold and all pinch rollers. Use the sheet basket at all times. 9) Stop detection with the END key. Increase the number of pinch rollers according to the sheet width. 10) Use the end pinch rollers in High Mode and, if necessary, set the inner pinch rollers to High Mode as well. Correct the detect-start position with the jog keys and press the ENTER HOLD key to retry. 11) When the distance between registration marks is large, small registration marks may go unrecognized because of possible displacement due to a sheet slant, etc. Stop detection with the END key and increase the registration mark size before retry (follow suggested values in the Operation Manual). If the sheet is slanted too much, the problem can be corrected by resetting the sheet in upright position. 12) Stop detection with the END key, increase the gap and retry.
