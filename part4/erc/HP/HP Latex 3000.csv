Description;PPS misalignment. Run diagnostics to recover PPS subsystem. If the problem persists, call HP service. The relative movement of one of the PPS modules with respect to the other is incorrect, which means that there is danger of a misalignment of the complete system. With this system error the system is protecting itself to prevent any possible damage. This system error can also happen when the distance between the homing position and the engage position is more than 7 mm.
Causes;a. A trapped obstruction has damaged the power transmission and has broken the mechanical power chain. b. Moving down a homing sensor has been activated or the PPS switch has failed.
Remedy;1. Restart the printer. 2. Try to move the carriage beam to the normal position (from the Internal Print Server or Print Care). If it is still failing, reboot in diagnostic mode and perform the same operation from Print Care. 3. From the diagnostic mode, perform the switch diagnostic, testing the four different homing switches of the PPS. 4. If the carriage beam is misaligned, perform a manual alignment by removing the PPS motor and turning the PPS gear system until they are aligned. 5.

Description;Servo shutdown PPS X not usable, but printing enabled/disabled depending on PPS value. If the problem persists, call your service representative. The meaning of X is: 1 = front right motor 2 = rear right motor 3 = rear left motor (IDS side) 4 = front left motor (IDS side) An error in the closed-loop control (servo control) of the PPS system has occurred. This error indicates that the PPS system is not moving as expected in closed-loop control. The servo-controlled movements consist of applying a specific PWM to a motor (a certain amount of energy) and receiving the feedback of an encoder about the actual movement of the motor after applying that specific PWM. Therefore, if after applying a specific PWM the encoder does not register the expected number of encoder counts (movement), the system will produce this error. Also if the PWM values come out of a certain range of values for the movement (i.e too high PWM to obtain a movement), this error is produced.
Causes;a. PWM signal not supplied to motor. PWM generator (driver) failure, motor failure, cable failure, or disconnected. b. Encoder signals indicating the movement not registered. Encoder disconnected, encoder broken or failed, cable disconnected, or the electrical system receiving the encoder signal has failed. c. PWM is too high due to a mechanical failure. Mechanical system jammed, mechanical system broken or loose. d. PPS system fuse failure. Contact between mechanical system fuse and the motor module.
Remedy;1. Check the connection of PPS motor power cable and encoder cables. 2. Check that power is supplied to the encoder PCA (LED in the main interconnect). 3. With PPS in the high position, unscrew the X-Y bushing, and check that it can move smoothly through the column. The screwdriver needs to be long. 4. With the PPS in the low position, remove the bottom stopper to the PPS screw (may need to remove the left and right curing module). 5. Remove each PPS screw with a flat screwdriver and then grease the parts. Check that there are no obstructions. 6. If you find plastic or metal obstructions, you will have to remove the corresponding PPS motor assembly later to clean it too. 7. If the high friction error continues, swap the PPS screw from one to the other, and check whether the failure is following the PPS screw. 8. Check mechanical blocking status in the system fuse.

Description;Movement X test fault. Subsystem disabled, but printing may be possible. If not, run diagnostics. If the problem still persists, call HP service. The meaning of X is: 1 = front right PPS movement test fault 2 = rear right PPS movement test fault 3 = rear left PPS movement test fault 4 = front left PPS movement test fault During start-up the printer produces an automatic check by making a small movement forwards and backwards to check the main system functionality (motor moves, encoder signals are received). This error is produced when this test fails. As the movement is very small, this error usually represents a critical error such as cables disconnected, motor failure, or a PCA fault.
Causes;a. Cable connection failure b. Rotor of the motor blocked c. Motor failure/encoder d. Main interconnect board failure (for the right PPS systems) e. Remote controller failure (for the left PPS systems)
Remedy;1. Check correct connection of PPS motor power cable and encoder cables. 2. Check that the motor is not blocked by anything. 3. Perform the PPS motor diagnostic test. 4. Check mechanical blocking status in the mechanical movement limiter. 5. Replace the PPS motor together with the encoder system and cabling. 6.

Causes;a. Environmental conditions of PCA driver b. Overworking conditions of driver in the PCA c. Main interconnect board failure (for the right PPS systems). d. Remote controller failure (for the left PPS systems)
Remedy;1. Perform carriage beam system recovery. If this is not possible, recover the system manually by removing the motor and aligning the PPS by hand. 2. Perform PPS motor diagnostic test. 3. Check correct connection of PPS motor power cable and encoder cables. 4. Perform move to load position and check the average and maximum points of PWM values for high constant values of friction. If the values are very high, grease the PPS system. If the system error persists, replace the PPS motor mount unit that fails. 5. Replace the main interconnect board or the remote controller board, depending on the failing side. œ E-cabinet PPS control motors: main interconnect œ IDS PPS controlled motors: remote controller board

Description;Drop-detector sensor 0X issue detected, sensor disabled. Run subsystem diagnostic. Call your support representative if diagnostic fails, or print quality is affected. The drop detectors’ basic operation consists of receiving power to feed an LED transmitter and a receiver situated at both sides of the drop-detector window. In standby with no drops or interference in the drop detector window, the transmitter is permanently powered and the receiver receives a signal of medium range (total range from 0 to 255, medium range signal around 127). The system error is displayed when the drop detector is 0 in standby (12 V supplied to the drop detectors, but there is no drop detection activity).
Causes;a. Drop detector disconnected b. Drop detector failed c. Service station interconnect board or cable failed d. Main interconnect board failed
Remedy;1. Make sure that the drop detector is correctly connected to the service station interconnect board. Use diagnostics to check whether the drop detector is disconnected or faulty. 2. Swap the problematical drop detector connection with another drop detector to check whether the problem is with the actual drop detector. If so, replace the drop detector. 3. Check the service station interconnect board cable connections at both ends. Make sure the cable is well connected and check cable integrity, replace parts if required. 4. Ensure power (12 V and 5 V) arrives to the board (Power LEDs on). Check the LEDs in the drop detector interconnect. 5. Replace service station interconnect board and cable. 6. Replace the OMAS PCA.

Description;Drop-detector sensor X not calibrated, sensor disabled. Run subsystem diagnostic. Call your support representative if diagnostic fails, or print quality is affected.. The drop detector is unable to detect its exact position to perform the drop detection. When performing a drop detection, the printer performs a synchronization with the linear encoder and the tail encoder located in the service station motor in order to establish its position with respect to the drop detector windows before performing the actual drop detection action. This error indicates that this synchronization cannot be achieved as the readings from the two encoders do not match according to the movements performed.
Causes;a. Intermittent failure mostly seen when previously used printheads are installed b. Drop detector linear encoder strip not correctly installed or connected c. Drop detector linear encoder sensor dirty, disconnected, or failed d. Incorrect calibration of drop detector system e. Power not arriving to the service station PCA f. Service station interconnect board or cable failure g. Main interconnect board failure
Remedy;1. Check the functionality of the drop detector. 2. Check the linear encoder strip in the service station. Make sure that the encoder strip is correctly installed in the sensor and well placed in its holders at each end. 3. Check the linear encoder sensor connection. Perform the drop detector diagnostic test to check the linear encoder. If the test fails, replace the encoder system. 4. Perform a drop detector calibration. 5. Ensure power (12 V and 5 V) is reaching the service station interconnect board (power LEDs on). 6. If power is getting through (LEDs on), replace the service station interconnect board and cable. 7. If there is no power (LEDs off), replace the main interconnect board. 8. Check the cable connections of the service station system. If no failure is found, replace the service station interconnect board. 9. Replace the main interconnect board. a. Print the nozzle check by following the directions in the service menu. b. Cancel the drying time to save 10–15 minutes. c. If no failure is detected, there no need to go further, the drop detector is working correctly and the intermittent system error is due to the high usage of the printheads.
