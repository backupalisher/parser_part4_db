Description;Continuable paper motor shutdown: Paper jam or motor hardware problem Servo shutdown: Paper servo shutdown Paper jam
Causes;Paper jam or motor hardware problem.
Remedy;Call agent: 1. Swtich off the printer. 2. Open the Window observing all safety procedure,s and check for any visible obstacles restricting the movement of the Drive Roller. If there is a wrinkled mass of media inside the paper path, lift the Pinchwheels (using the Media Lever) and clear the obstruction. 3. Switch on the printer. 4. Follow the instructions in the Front Panel.

Description;"Paper servo shutdown; possible paper jam"
Causes;Possible paper jam.
Remedy;Service engineer: 1. If the substrate is nearing the end of the roll, check the remaining substrate is not strongly glued to the substrate core. 2. Open the Window, observing all safety procedures check for any visible obstacles restricting the movement of the Drive Roller. If there is a wrinkled mass of substrate inside the paper path, lift the Pinchwheels (using the Substrate Lever) and clear the obstruction. 3. Check the performance of the rewinder system as it may also cause a servo shutdown. 4. Check that the OMAS Controller Card to PrintMech PCA cable is not damaged. 5. Check that the OMAS Controller Card to PrintMech PCA cable is correctly connected to the OMAS Controller Card and the PrintMech PCA. 6. Perform the Drive Roller service test. 7. If the error continues, replace the Substrate Axis Motor.

Description;It was impossible to correctly stop the servo before setting the encoder position
Causes;It was impossible to correctly stop the servo before setting the encoder position.
Remedy;Call agent: • Open the Window observing all safety procedures and check for any visible obstacles restricting the movement of the Drive Roller. If there is a wrinkled mass of substrate inside the paper path, lift the Pinchwheels (using the Substrate Lever) and clear the obstruction. Service engineer: 1. Perform the Substrate Path service test. 2. Replace the Substrate-Axis Motor.
Code;85:03
Description;Problem finding the Drive Roller zero
Causes;Problem finding the Drive Roller zero.
Remedy;Call agent: • If the substrate is attached to TUR, cut the substrate and ensure that the substrate at the output side is not held by the TUR. Service engineer: • Perform the Substrate Drive Diagnostic.
Code;86:01
Description;There is a problem with the carriage assembly
Causes;There is a problem with the carriage assembly.
Remedy;
Code;87:01
Description;Encoder strip should be cleaned
Causes;The encoder strip is dirty.
Remedy;Call agent: • Clean the encoder strip by following the respective process in the Front Panel menu. Service engineer: • Replace the encoder strip.
Code;87:02
Description;Excessive carriage friction detected: Clean and lubricate both carriage rails
Causes;Lack of lubrication on scan axis rails. Accumulation of dirt or aerosol on scan axis rails.
Remedy;Call agent: • Clean and lubricate both carriage rails. Service engineer: • Clean and lubricate both carriage rails.
Code;89.1:10
Description;Inner light PCA array 1 disconnected
Causes;Printzone leds array 1 disconnected.
Remedy;Service engineer: • Restart the printer. Service engineer: • Open circuit detected at array 1: At least one of the leds could be fused. Replace one of the inner lights PCAs and check if the problem is solved. If not, continue the troubleshooting by replacing sequentially another PCA. Use diagnostics utility to switch the array On & Off
Code;89.2:10
Description;Inner light PCA array 2 disconnected
Causes;Printzone leds array 2 disconnected.
Remedy;Service engineer: • Restart the printer. Service engineer: • Open circuit detected at array 2: At least one of the leds could be fused. Replace one of the inner lights PCAs and check if the problem is solved. If not, continue the troubleshooting by replacing sequentially another PCA. Use diagnostics utility to switch the array On & Off
Code;89:11
Description;Printzone leds both arrays disconnected
Causes;Printzone leds both arrays disconnected.
Remedy;Service engineer: • Restart the printer. Service engineer: • One of the Inner lights PCAs might be disconnected, please ensure the connectors between PCAs are properly fitted or reconnect them.
Code;94:01
Description;CLC failed because paper white point is out of valid range
Causes;Paper white point is out of valid range.
Remedy;Call agent: • Ensure the loaded substrate is white and there aren`t spots on it.
Code;94:02
Description;CLC failed, inconsistencies in measures detected
Causes;Inconsistencies in CLC measures detected.
Remedy;Call agent: 1. Check substrate type selection in front panel corresponds to actual substrate loaded. 2. Retry calibration.
Code;94:08
Description;Color Calibration failed
Causes;Color Calibration failed.
Remedy;Call agent: • Try again or check user manual color calibration troubleshooting.
Code;94:10
Description;CLC measures out of range
Causes;Aerosol or other malfunction of Color Sensor prevents calibration.
Remedy;Service engineer: 1. Retry calibration. 2. Replace SOL.
Code;98:03
Description;Potential Print Quality problem. Detected too many nozzles out
Causes;Check PH using the PH status plot.
Remedy;Service engineer: • Use the printhead status plot to find out which printheads have a massive number of nozzles out, and replace them.
