Description;Finisher stay jam at either PI33 or PI34 when engine powered on. When the engine is powered on, the finisher`s upper-feed-path-entry sensor (PI33) or the upper-feed-path-exit sensor (PI34) is activated suggesting that there is paper in the upper paper path of the finisher at sensors PI33 or PI34.
Remedy;Signal generated from PI33 (upper-feedpath- entry sensor) and PI34 (upper-feedpath- exit sensor) 1. Open the top door and remove any media in the paper path (media detected at PI33). 2. Raise the upper paper path (exit) delivery rollers and remove any media in the paper path (media detected at PI34). 3. Check these sensors for obstructions. Verify that the sensor flags are not damaged, move freely, and are correctly aligned with the sensor body and properly mounted. Also check wiring and connectors for damage or loose connections. 4. Carefully clean the sensor body by gently blowing clean air across the sensor to remove dust and debris. 5. Verify that the sensor connectors (J708 and J707) are fully seated on the stacker controller PCA. 6. Replace sensor PI33 and PI34. 7.

Description;Finisher delay jam at PI33. The engine signals the finisher that paper is about to enter the finisher from the IPTU. The finisher`s upper-feed-path-entry sensor (PI33), which detects paper entering the finisher, does not detect the paper within the expected time period triggering the error.
Remedy;Open the IPTU and the finisher top door and check the following items: • If media is found in the IPTU but has not reached the finisher, perform the following steps: • Remove and then reinstall the IPTU. Make sure that the connector is fully seated and that the IPTU is securely fastened. • If the error persists, replace the IPTU. • If media is jammed at the exit point of the IPTU (prior to entering the finisher), perform the following steps: • Verify that the finisher is securely fastened to the engine. • Make sure that the finisher and IPTU are correctly aligned. Adjust the finisher castors to obtain a uniform gap between the finisher and the engine. The engine-tofinisher gap must be the same at the bottom and the top so that the finisher is parallel to the engine. With the engine-to-finisher gap correct, make sure that the finisher paper path entry point is aligned with the IPTU exit point. • Check the finisher entry point guides for damage. • Verify that the finisher rollers are turning before the media leaves the IPTU. If the rollers are not turning, test motor M9 by using the finisher component test from the controlpanel display. If the motor does not activate during the test, check the connectors for motor M9 (inlet motor). Make sure that connector J705 is fully seated on the stacker controller PCA. If the error persists, replace motor M9 or the saddle paper-feeder assembly. Only if the error persists and the previous steps fail to correct the problem, replace the stacker controller PCA. • If media is found in the finisher but has not reached sensor PI33, perform the following steps: • Check the upper and lower guides and rollers in the paper path for damage. • Make sure that the media diverter gate (saddle-stitch flapper) is not blocking the paper path. • If media is found in the finisher covering sensor PI33 (the sensor is not detecting the media), perform the following steps: • Check the sensor for obstructions. Verify that the sensor flag is not damaged, moves freely, and is correctly aligned with the sensor body• Make sure that the lower end of the flag is not damaged and is correctly positioned to activate the sensor. • Make sure that the sensor is securely fastened to the chassis. • Carefully clean the sensor body by gently blowing clean air across the sensor to remove dust and debris. • Verify that the wiring at the sensor is not damaged and that the intermediate connector J1007 and connector J708 on the stacker controller PCA are fully seated. Replace the sensor if necessary. • Only if the error persists and the previous steps fail to correct the problem, replace the stacker controller PCA.

Also occurs when the swing guide does not return to its home position (swing-guide home-position sensor: PI35) after the swing motor (M36) is activated for 3 seconds.
Remedy;Control panel diagnostics: M36 (Swing Motor) and PI35 (Swing Guide Home Position Sensor) 1. Test the swing motor M36 by using the finisher component test from the controlpanel display. NOTE: When activated during the component test, the motor should rotate for about five seconds. While the motor is rotating, make sure that the swing guide is moving up or down at the exit area for stapling and stacking. • If the swing guide freely moves up and down, proceed to the next step (testing the swing-guide sensor PI35). • If the swing guide does not freely move up and down, remove the finisher rear cover and use your hand to turn the gear located to the right of motor M36 clockwise. • If the swing guide moves upward, the gears are properly working. Replace motor M36. If after replacing the motor the motor still does not turn on, replace the stacker controller PCA. • If the swing guide does not move, inspect the gears and replace damaged components as necessary. 2. Test the swing-guide sensor PI35 by using the finisher component test from the control-panel display. NOTE: Manually lift the swing guide to the highest position, and then look at the control-panel display and verify a change in state for the sensor. • If the sensor state does not change, perform the following steps: • Verify that the connector J707 on the stacker controller PCA is fully seated and not damaged. • Manually activate the sensor PI35 at the sensor body. If the control panel does not indicate a change of state, replace the sensor. • If raising the swing guide does not activate the sensor but it can be manually activated at the sensor body, replace the swing-guide assembly. • If the PI35 sensor state does change, check the drive gears for damage or obstructions. Replace components as necessary.

Display;66.12.51
Description;Finisher error- rear-booklet-stapler motor (M6) The booklet-maker stitch staplers do not move to different locations in relation to the paper like the main stapler. The only movement is through the movement of the rotary cam located on the stapler unit itself, during the actual stapling of the booklet. The stitch-home-position switch (SW5) is part of the rear stitch stapler unit and senses the stapler opening and closing during stapling by the motion of the rotary drive cam. Like SW5, the stitch motor (M6) is also part of the overall stitch-stapler unit and replacement requires the replacement of saddle-stapler assembly. Error occurs when the front booklet-makerstapler stitching-home-position sensor (SW5) does not turn on when the stitch motor (rear) (M6) has been driven forward for 0.5 seconds. Also occurs when the front booklet-makerstapler stitching-home-position sensor (SW5) does not turn off when the stitch motor (rear) (M6) has been driven forward for 0.5 seconds.
Remedy;Control panel diagnostics: none 1. Check the rear-stitch stapler for jammed staples, and then perform the following steps: • Clear jammed staples, and then check the staple unit for damage. Retest the stapler. • If the error continues, check the following items: Make sure that HP-approved staples are used. Replace the staple cartridge with one containing HPapproved staples. If the error continues, replace the saddle-stapler assembly • If the error persists, but no damage is found, proceed to the next step. 2. If the error persists and no jammed staples are found, perform the following steps: • Verify that connector J8 on the saddle-stitcher controller PCA is fully seated and not damaged. Check the wiring at the rearsaddle- stitch stapler and the saddle-stapler assembly for damage and proper seating• Also inspect the connector that the saddle-stitch stapler assembly engages inside finisher, for damage and foreign material in the connector as well as for proper seating with the saddle-stitch stapler assembly. • Only if the error persists and the previous steps fail to correct the problem, replace the saddlestitcher controller PCA.
