Display;65.00.15 Output Device Failure
Description;"After the MFP boot process, the external device requested a new boot process. This can happen during an upgrade; the 24 V power goes off momentarily, which makes the stapler/stacker think it is initializing again. NOTE: During an upgrade of the external device, if the connection with the device is lost for 9 minutes, the firmware crashes with a 66.00.15 error and forces the user to reboot. It will then display a Resend external accessory firmware message."
Remedy;1. Turn off the MFP. 2. Disconnect the communication cable between the output device and the MFP. 3. Check the connection pins for damage. 4. Reconnect the communication cable to the MFP, making sure the connector is properly screwed down in. 5. Turn on the printer. 6. Reload the latest firmware bundle. 7.

Code;65.12.01
Display;65.12.01 Output Device Failure
Description;The paddle (retainer) motor M1301 was not able to move the sensor flag to the home position detected by sensor PS1305. This signal is generated by sensor PS1305 (paddle home-position sensor). Sensor PS1305 is located on the rear frame of the stapler/stacker, between the two DC motors: M1301 Paddle motor, and M1303 Feed Motor.
Remedy;1. Turn the MFP off then on. 2. Reinstall the stapler/stacker. 3. If none of the above corrects the problem, replace the stapler/stacker unit.
Code;65.12.02
Display;65.12.02 Output Device Failure
Description;Jogger-motor malfunction. The jogger home position could not be sensed by sensor PS1304. This signal is generated by sensor PS1304 (jogger home-position sensor). Sensor PS1304 is located on the jogger assembly and can be accessed after removing the front, rear, and top covers of the stapler/ stacker.
Remedy;1. Check for anything that might be obstructing or restricting the movement of the jogger guides. 2. Turn the MFP off then on. 3. Reinstall the stapler/stacker. 4. If none of the above corrects the problem, replace the stapler/stacker unit.
Code;65.12.03
Display;65.12.03 Output Device Failure
Description;Staple-motor malfunction. The staple motor was unable to return to the home position as read by sensor PHOl1. This signal is generated by sensor PHOl1 (stapler home-position sensor). PHOl1 is located in the stapler assembly and cannot be serviced. If the stapler drive does not return to home position (HP) during the normal cycle, the stapler/stacker driver signals M1304 (stapler motor) to rotate once in reverse. If the HP signal is not detected, the stapler/stacker driver sends a signal to the formatter that the staple motor has malfunctioned.
Remedy;"1. Check for a staple jam in the stapler; remove any jammed staples. 2. Turn the MFP off then on. 3. If none of the above corrects the problem, replace the stapler/stacker unit."

Code;65.12.35
Display;65.12.35 Output Device Failure
Description;Stapler malfunction. The stapler self-prime sensor PHOl2 did not activate. This signal is generated by sensor PHOl2 (staple-ready sensor). Sensor PHOl2 is located in the stapler assembly and cannot be serviced. When a new staple cartridge is installed, the stapler goes through the stapling motion 11 times in order to advance the first staple to the proper stapling position. If the staples are not advanced after 11 attempts, the control board notifies the formatter that self-priming has failed.
Remedy;1. Verify that genuine HP staples are being used and that the staples are the correct type for this stapler. NOTE: Staples come preloaded in the staple cartridge and cannot be ordered separately as a refill from HP. 2. Replace the staple cartridge. 3. If none of the above corrects the problem, replace the stapler/stacker unit.

Code;99.XX.YY
Display;99.XX.YY
Description;This error occurs during a Remote Firmware Upgrade (RFU). The upgrade might have failed due to a failing component or because the existing firmware is the same as the firmware in the RFU.
Remedy;1. Turn the MFP off and then on. 2. Try to perform an RFU on the MFP again. 3. If the RFU fails, check the description in the engine event log. The event log identifies the type of 99 error. If it is failing due to the firmware being the latest available, no upgrade is necessary and the error should be ignored. 4. Ensure the connections are secure at the formatter and the output devices.
