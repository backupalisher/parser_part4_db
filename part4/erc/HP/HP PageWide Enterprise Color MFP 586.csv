Remedy;To avoid this condition, always use trade cartridges after initialization has completed and the original startup cartridges are spent. Startup cartridges can only be used the first time the product is initialized. Once a startup cartridge has been used for initialization it’s memory tag contents are changed to indicate it will now behave and be detected as a trade cartridge.

Remedy;The print quality should not degrade in any way when the ink cartridge approaches end-of-life as the product will halt printing when all of the usable ink has been depleted. Customers should have a spare cartridge on-hand as the indicated cartridge will transition to Empty in just a few pages. If print quality is not acceptable replace the indicated cartridge.

Description;Ink Collection Unit Warning Ink Collection Unit almost full. The percentage of life remaining is 2%. The product’s Ink Collection Unit (ICU) collects unused ink for later disposal. The life tracking on this supply is accomplished via a numeric percent life remaining (PLR) that starts at 100% and decreases in 1% increments as pages are printed. The engine counts the number of ink droplet that go into the ICU and reports this information to the formatter as a percentage of life remaining. The expected life of the ICU is nominally 120,000 page but this will vary depending on printing patterns.
Remedy;A new ICU should be ordered and printing can continue. NOTE: There is no sensor that indicates when the ICU has been replaced. For this reason the user will be asked near end of ICU life if the ICU has been replaced each time the left door closes or a power-on occurs.

Description;A job framework internal error has occurred.
Remedy;1. No action should be necessary.2. If the error persists, upgrade the product firmware.3.

Code;49.XX.YY
Description;Error To continue turn off then on A firmware error occurred. Corrupted print jobs, software application issues, non-product specific print drivers, poor quality USB or network cables, bad network connections or incorrect configurations, invalid firmware operations, or unsupported accessories can cause this error.
Remedy;1. Turn the product off, and then on. 2. If the error persists, check the following: • The error might be caused by a network connectivity problem, such as a bad interface cable, a bad USB port, or an invalid network configuration setting. • The error might be caused by the print job, due to an invalid print driver, a problem with the software application, or a problem with the file being printed. • Upgrading the product firmware might help resolve the error. See the product user guide for more information. When a 49 error occurs, the user sees a 49.XXXX message on the control panel (where XXXX is replaced by a combination of letters and numbers). A 49 error might happen at any time for multiple reasons. Although some types of 49 errors can be caused by hardware failures, it is more common for 49 errors to be caused by printing a specific document or performing some task on the product. 49 errors most often occur when a product is asked to perform an action that the product firmware is not capable of and might not have been designed to comply with, such as: • Printing files with unsupported programming commands • A unique combination of user environment and user interactions with the product • Interfacing with a third-party solution that was not designed to work with the product • Specific timing, network traffic, or concurrent processing of jobs Each of these interactions could cause the product firmware to initiate an action that the product cannot accomplish. In situations like this, the product might present the error if it has no other option. When these errors occur, the only way to recover is to turn the product`s power off and back on. NOTE: LaserJet formatter PCAs are rarely the root cause of 49 service errors. Please do not replace the formatter or flash unless troubleshooting has identified the formatter as the root cause. If the error persists, continue troubleshooting with the flowcharts for either Intermittent or Persistent 49 error troubleshooting (whichever is appropriate) in document c03122817, gHP LaserJet FutureSmart Devices - 49 Error Troubleshooting (Persistent and Intermittent).

Remedy;1. Turn the power off on the product by pressing the power button and holding it for more than 3 seconds. 2. Unplug power cord from back of product and wait 30 seconds. 3. Plug power cord back into product. 4. Turn the power on to the product using power button. 5. If the error condition is cleared then the issue is resolved, if not continue to step 6. 6. Repeat steps 1 & 2. 7. Remove the formatter, check formatter thoroughly for any loose connections and reseat them, then reinstall the formatter. 8. Repeat steps 3 & 4. 9. If the error condition is cleared then the issue is resolved, if issue is not resolved replace the Mech Kit. NOTE: It is critical to either print the event log after power cycle clears issue, or access the event log through EWS and capture the 8 character fail code value corresponding to the 61.00.0X and log it into the case. Look for the last 61.00.0x error that occurred which also has the 8 character value under the text . This value is critical in HP understanding the failure and debugging potential field issues.
