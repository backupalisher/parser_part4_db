Remedy;Restart the product.
Code;71:04
Description;Out of memory. The total memory available in the product depends on its configuration. It is reported as HPGL/ 2 memory or PS/PDF memory. If the amount of memory that the product needs to process the file is more than the amount available, the product will display this system warning. The amount of memory required for processing the file is known as the edisplay list memoryf: • The display list memory should not be confused with the file size of the print job. The size of the display list memory depends on several variables such as the resolution, file size and file content. • The display list memory is not visible to the user, but can be consulted by engineers to troubleshoot out-of-memory issues. See Appendix D: How to check the display list memory for an HP-GL/2 job • There have been a few cases in which a print job with a relatively small file size has triggered an out-of-memory message. Such print jobs typically have a large number of objects in them or have complex objects such as raster images with gradients or objects with multiple layers.
Remedy;"1. Upgrade the firmware to the latest version available. 2. Decrease the print resolution to 300 dpi. NOTE: If the customer does not accept the print quality after reducing the resolution or using Econofast print mode, proceed to the workaround in step 3. • The resolution required by the product to process the file is set by the print mode selected (Best, Normal, Fast). There is a setting available that enables you to decrease the resolution for each print mode to 300 dpi. If this setting is used, the rendering resolution will be reduced, but the output (printing) resolution will remain the default of the selected print mode. There could be an impact on Image Quality because of the reduction in the rendering resolution; this will be especially noticeable in circles and lines with very low inclination. 3. Use the ‘Econofast’ print mode. The rendering resolution will be set by default to 300 dpi. In the Paper/Quality tab of the product properties window, select Custom options and press the Settings button. In the Custom Print Quality Options window, check the Economode box. NOTE: If the Out of Memory message still persists, proceed to the next workaround. 4. Out of Memory issues can always be solved if the processing of the job can be performed before reaching the product. This can be done by selecting ‘Send Job as Bitmap’. The main processing of the print job will then be performed by the computer. This form of printing is recommended when the print job contains raster images, and mixed plots with raster images and lines, because the process of turning a print job made of raster images to vector images leads to a significant increase in the display list memory."

Description;Problem with paper advance. This source of error could come from an error in any of the following systems: paper motor, disk encoder, cables or main electronics.
Remedy;"This error can occur because the product has been dropped during transportation, causing structural damage. Before continuing with the 81:YZ troubleshooting, first look for structural damage. To identify the structural damage, look for the following three things: • Consistent 81:YZ error codes. • Platen fingers rubbing on the roller surface, leaving black marks on the roller. • A gap on the platen beam. If therefs any gap in Z (vertical direction) between the plastic feature of the platen and the metal side plate, then the chassis is damaged and the unit cannot be repaired. 1.
