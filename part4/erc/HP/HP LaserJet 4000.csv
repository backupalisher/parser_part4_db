Display;11 Paper Out
Description;"Paper tray empty or not seated correctly. A buildup of toner on the edges of the tray which slide into the printer can sometimes cause problems. Take a sharp tool, like a razor blade and scrape the buildup off these edges.
 Sensor Arm Stuck or Broken - check for free movement of the sensor arm. Sensor flag can get knocked out of place when a paper jam occurs and the tray is pulled out abruptly. Most times this can simply be reinstalled. If it`s broken, you will need to replace the sensor flag.
 Defective Tray Size Sensing or Configuration - Most trays have tabs which depress a series of switches when installed. Verify that the tabs aren`t damaged and that the tray switches located in the printer are not damaged. You can depress these by hand and hear them click. Occasionally the contact for the micro switch will get bent and will have to be replaced. Also verify the configuration through the menus on the printer.
 Defective Paper Control Sensor PCB - These do fail and will need to be replaced."

Display;12 Printer Open
Description;Top cover open or a broken tab on the cover assembly. On rare occasions a defective paper control assembly or actuator can cause this problem. Verify the tab on the cover is not broken.
Code;13
Display;13 Paper Jam
Description;"Check the paper, make sure it meets the paper specifications for your printer. Tractor feed paper with the edges ripped off doesn`t seem to work very well. Extremely heavy or thick paper is also a problem. Check the HP paper specification guide for more info. Be careful with labels, use only labels designed to take the heat generated by the fuser assembly. Regular labels my ""ooze"" adhesive as they pass through the fuser assembly and literally gum up the works! Also check for any partially peeled labels, this can be a disaster if they come off inside the printer.
 Is the paper size correct? Is the software set for the size you`re using? Is the menu set for the size you`re using? Check these items. If the software tells the printer to expect a different size (legal, A4, COM10) than the tray available, you will get an error. This can happen when printing a FAX document formatted for A4 size paper.
 You could also have a defective or dirty exit sensor. Replace or clean as needed.
 Make sure the paper cassettes are installed correctly. A buildup of toner on the edges of the tray which slide into the printer can sometimes cause problems. Take a sharp tool, like a razor blade and scrape the buildup off these edges.
 Bad drive gears. Again on the LJII/III we are starting to see more and more failures of the gear drive assembly. A broken tooth on one gear is all it takes. Replace this as an assembly.
 Listen for the motor operation, make sure it`s operational. If not replace the motor or drive circuit as required."

Display;14 No EP Cartridge
Description;"On the 4V/4MV check the toner cartridge micro switch on the High Voltage PCB - SW501.
 Also on the 4V/4MV check the door open sensor (PS402) on the terminal board located under the transfer roller.
 Can also be caused by a defective DC controller. Pretty rare though."
Code;16
Display;16 Toner Low
Description;"Toner cartridge is empty or toner in cartridge is not distributed evenly. Gently shake the toner cartridge both from side to side and from front to back. This can generally get you 100 or so more pages.
 Bad or dirty cartridge contacts. Look for the conductive contacts on the cartridge and the corresponding contacts in the printer and make sure they are clean and free of contaminants."

Description;"This indicates a communication problem between the formatter PCA and an optional interface installed (such as a network card). Remove and reseat the optional interface card. If the problem continues, remove the optional interface card and set the printer for standard parallel interface by taking off-line and holding down ""Menu"" key for 5-10 seconds. Scroll through items until ""I/O ="" appears and use the +/- key to display parallel and the enter key to select. Then put the printer back online and send a test job from the host computer via the parallel cable. If this is successful, you have a problem with the optional I/O card and should replace it or reset it."
