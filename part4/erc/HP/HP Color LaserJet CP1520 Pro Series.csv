Code;50.10
Display;50.10 Fuser error
Description;Fuser is defective (abnormal high temperature of the thermistor)
Remedy;1. Reconnect the connectors of the fuser unit (J802) and DC controller PCA (J104). 2. Measure the resistance between the connector J802-1 and J802-3 on the fuser. If the resistance is not within the range from approximately 220 kOhm to 660 k (at ambient temperatures), replace the fuser. 3. Replace the fuser power supply unit.

Display;50.12 Fuser error
Description;Fuser is defective (Fuser 1 pressure release mechanism failure)
Remedy;1. Reconnect the connectors of the DC controller PCA (J110, J115). 2. Check the sensor flag of the fuser pressure release sensor. If the sensor flag is damaged, replace it. 3. Replace the fuser motor. 4. Replace the high-voltage power supply unit. 5. Replace the fuser unit.
Code;50.2
Display;50.2 Fuser error
Description;Fuser is defective (warm-up failure)
Remedy;1. Reconnect the connectors of the fuser unit (J802) and DC controller PCA (J104). 2. Measure the resistance between the connector J801-1 and J801-3 on the fusier. If the resistance is not within the range from approximately 220 kOm to 660 kOm (at ambient temperatures), replace the fuser. 3. Reconnect the connectors of the fuser power supply unit (J201, J202, J203). 4. Measure the resistance between the connector J801-1 and J801-2 on the fuser. If the resistance is not within the range from approximately 21 0hm to 25 Ohm (at ambient temperatures), replace the fuser. 5. If the message persists, replace the fuser power supply unit.

Reconnect the connectors of the fuser power supply unit (J201, J202, J203). 4. Measure the resistance between the connector J801-1 and J801-2 on the fuser. If the resistance is not within the range from approximately 21 O to 25 O (at ambient temperatures), replace the fuser. 5. Replace the fuser. 6. Replace the fuser power supply unit.
Code;50.6
Display;50.6 Fuser error
Description;Fuser is defective (drive circuit failure)
Remedy;1. Reconnect the connectors of the fuser power supply unit (J201, J202, J203) and DC controller PCA (J105). 2. Check the power source. If the power generator is used, improve the situation. NOTE: If the product does not meet the power requirement of 40 to 70Hz frequency, the fuser temperature control does not work properly and this causes malfunction. 3. Replace the fuser power supply unit.
