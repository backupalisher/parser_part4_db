Code;49
Display;49.ERROR XXXX
Description;Indicates that a firmware error occurred that caused the processor on the formatter to abort operation. This type of error can be caused by invalid print commands, corrupt data, or invalid operations. In some cases, electrical noise in the cable can corrupt data during transmission to the printer. Other causes include poor quality parallel cables, poor connections, or home-grown applications. On rare occasions, the formatter is at fault, which is usually indicated by a 79 Service Error
Remedy;1. Turn the printer off and on to reset the printer. 2. Verify that all cables are connected. 3. Cancel all print jobs then resend. Try to isolate any offending print job. 4. Delete the print job from the Windows spooler or from the print server. 5.

Code;50.7
Display;50.7 FUSER ERROR
Description;The fusing motor (M1) drives the fusing assembly, the paper transport (web) assembly, ITB lift mechanism, transfer roller, transfer roller lift mechanism, and the face down output delivery drive assembly. A 50.7 fuser error appears when PS6 detects no motion within the fuser. Photosensor PS6 is the fusing unit pressure switch
Remedy;1. Power cycle the printer to try to clear the message. 2. Remove the left-side cover of the printer. Verify that the fusing motor (M1) connector is seated firmly into J102 of the feed PCB. 3. Ensure that the connector at J110 of the feed PCB is firmly seated (this connector contains the wiring for PS6, which provides fuser-motion feedback). Note Closely inspect the mechanical linkage. The gears along the gear “drive” path can bind the gears, which will prevent M1 from rotating. 4. If the error persists, Observe the drive shaft of M1 while powering on the printer. If this shaft DOES NOT rotate, your failure is related to the motor drive circuitry. Referring to the printer’s wiring diagram, verify that connectors J102 and J106 of the feed PCB are firmly seated. If the error still persists, replace the fusing motor and the feed PCB in sequence. 5. If the shaft rotates (both forward and reverse), and the 50.7 fuser error appears, the cause of the error is related to the motion feedback circuitry. Remove the fusing assembly and verify the sensor flag (see Figure 7-27) is in good condition and functional. Verify the connector at sensor PS6 is firmly seated. Clean the sensor of dust and debris. If the error persists replace sensor PS6
Code;50.x
Display;50.x Fuser Error
Description;The fusing assembly contains two heating bulbs, two thermo-switches, and two thermistors. AC power is provided to the fusing assembly via the DC power supply, which is controlled by the DC controller PCB. The thermistors monitor the temperature of the fusing assembly and provide feedback to the DC controller PCB to regulate the fusing temperature. The two thermo-switches are wired in series with the fusing bulbs, and “open” if the temperature exceeds 240° C (464° F). X  1 Low temperature error 2 Fuser warm-up service 3 High fuser temperature 4 Faulty fuser 5 Fuser voltage mismatch (verify that you have NOT installed a 110V fuser in a 220V printer or vice-versa). 6 Fuser heater cutoff 7 Fuser motor malfunction (see recommended action for 50.7 Fuser error)
Remedy;1. Turn the printer off and on to reset the printer. If the error persists, try re-installing the fusing assembly. If the error continues to persist, proceed to step 2. 2. Turn the power off and remove the fusing assembly. Measure the resistance between pin 3 and pin 4. The resistance should be between 6+/-2 ohms. If there is no continuity between pins, it can be assumed that either a heating bulb and/or a thermo-switch is “open.” Replace the fusing assembly. If resistance limits are acceptable, proceed to step 3. 3. Referring to Figure 7-36, measure the resistance for both the upper and lower thermistors. The resistance should be between 430K ohms and 310K ohms at room temperature (25° C, 77° F). If the resistance exceeds limits, replace the fusing assembly. If resistance is within limits proceed to step 4. 4. Verify the connectors at J1011 of the DC controller PCB and J1 of the DC power supply assembly are firmly seated. 5. Replace the power supply assembly.

Code;54.2
Display;54.2 PRINTER ERROR
Description;Indicates that a problem exists with the carousel assembly. Either the carousel is not rotating or the sensor has failed. Drive motor (M3) provides drive for the toner cartridge carousel. If motion is not detected, a 54.2 error appears. M3 is a 6-phase stepping motor and receives its drive signal from J203 of the developing PCB. Photosensor PS10 monitors “movement” (and the position) of the toner cartidge carousel. Different width tabs (four tabs, one for each cartridge) on the left-end of the carousel housing pass through PS10 to provide positioning information. The black toner cartridge tab is the home position. Toner cartridge position within the carousel is monitored by PS11. If PS11 fails or is improperly connected, a 54.2 error appears. Another indicator of this is that the carousel starts to rotate then stops immediately. A 54.2 error message can also occur if the sensor is installed backwards.
Remedy;1. Turn the printer off and then on to reset the printer. 2. Open the color toner door and look for an obstruction. If necessary, remove the toner cartridges individually by manually releasing the carousel brake and rotating the carousel around to each cartidge position and removing the cartridges. Turn the printer off and on to reset the printer. Note The printer CANNOT operate with the top cover removed unless the carousel brake has been released or removed. 3. Verify the carousel drive motor wiring harness is firmly seated into connector J203 of the developing PCB (see Figure 7-38). 4. Verify PS10 (refer to Figure 7-31) is working correctly and not excessively dirty (clean if necessary) and that the wiring harness is firmly seated into both the sensor assembly and connector J206 of the developing PCB. 5. Verify PS11 is connected and functioning properly. 6. Verify all connectors to the developing PCB and the DC controller PCB are firmly seated. 7. Verify that the rotary drive assembly is working. Replace it on older units with more than 50K of life.
Code;54.3
Display;54.3 PRINTER ERROR
Description;The printer is not receiving data back from the density sensor (PS14). PS14 is located in the bottom of the imaging drum drawer (refer to Figure 7-30). During calibration routines, a series of images are written on the imaging drum and the densitometer measures the density of the image (e.g. amount of toner that is placed into the drum). These measurements provide the feedback to ensure image quality is consistent throughout the life of the consumable.
Remedy;"1. Verify the densitometer is clean; perform the toner density sensor cleaning procedure in Chapter 7 of the online user guide. 2. Inspect the density sensor wiring harness for damage. The harness runs from the density sensor through the left-side upper control arm of the imaging drum drawer to J1010 of the DC controller PCB. Verify that the cable is firmly seated into the J1010 of the DC controller PCB. 3. If the error persists, replace the density sensor assembly."
