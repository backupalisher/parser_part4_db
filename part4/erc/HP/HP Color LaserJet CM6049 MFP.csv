Description;Finisher error - micro switches - doors There are three switches in the bookletmaker finisher: SW1 (saddle-guide switch also known as the inlet-door switch), SW3 the booklet-ejection-door switch, and MS31 the front-door switch. The stapler/stacker finisher only has one switch, MS31 for the front door of the finisher. All three switches detect if the associated door or guide plate is open or closed. Each of the switches also have a sensor (SW1/PI9, SW3/PI3, and MS31/PI32) that acts as a backup and detects the same information as the switches. The error occurs when all the doors and guides are closed and there is a mismatch in readings between the sensors and the switches. For example, the front finisher door is closed, PI32 senses the door is closed and MS31 senses the door is still open. Associated finisher door and guide switches and sensors are as follows: • Saddle-guide switch SW1 and saddleguide sensor PI9 • Booklet-ejection-door switch SW3 and booklet-ejection-door sensor PI3 • Front-door switch MS31 and front-door sensor PI32
Remedy;Control-panel diagnostics: PI32 (front-door-1 sensor), PI3 (booklet door-1 sensor, also known as booklet-delivery-door sensor), PI9 (front-door-2 sensor, also known as the saddle-guide-door sensor or inlet-door sensor), SW3 (booklet-door 2) 1. Using the control-panel diagnostics, try to isolate which door or guide switch and sensor is causing the error. 2. Make sure that the sensors are securely fastened to the chassis. 3. Check the switches and sensors for damage and clean the sensors by gently blowing clean air into the sensor to remove dust and debris. 4. Check the wiring at the switches and sensors. 5. Check the tabs that activate the switches and sensors on the doors and guides for damage. Make sure that the tabs are aligned with the switches and sensors. Replace the doors and guides as necessary. 6. Verify that the following connectors are fully seated and not damaged: • Stacker controller PCA • J719 (MS31) • J707 (PI32) • Saddle-stitcher controller PCA • J4 (SW1) • J10 (PI9) • J4 (SW3) • J11 (PI3) 7. Only if the error persists and none of the previous steps correct the problem, replace the PCA that is associated with the failed switch/sensor (stacker controller PCA or saddle-stitcher controller PCA).
