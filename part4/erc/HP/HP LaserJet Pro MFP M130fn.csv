If the error persists, disconnect any network or USB cables and power cycle. If the product returns to Ready, check the FW version and update if a newer version is available.4. If the error persists, print a Service Page from the Reports menu. Also, print an Error Report from the 2ndary Service Menu. On the Service Page, look at the xxxx portion of the 49.xxxx errors listed: • If the numbers are all or mostly different, then power quality is a possible problem; try a different wall socket. • If the xxxx portion of 49.xxxx contain repeats of the same numbers or groups of numbers, then check the 2ndary Service Error Report printed earlier for indications of a failure in a particular area. The report may indicate whether the error is caused by a network problem or a problem with the job. 5. If the error persists, replace the product. NOTE: If the 49 Error is caused by the network or a specific file, do not replace the product; it will not resolve the issue. Instead, attempt to isolate the issue in a way that demonstrates the error is caused by something in the environment. 6. If the error persists after product replacement, escalate to Level 3 so that Technical Marketing has visibility to the problem."
