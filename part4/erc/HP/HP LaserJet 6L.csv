Description;"ROM/RAM Error.
 An error was found with the ROM or RAM. The printer believes that the ROM is corrupted or an error has been found in the RAM."
Remedy;"1. Power-cycle the printer by unplugging the printer and plugging it back in. If this doesn’t clear the error:
 2. Unplug the printer, remove any optional memory, then power the printer back on. If the message clears, replace the memory card.
 3. Replace the Formatter PCA."

Description;"Fuser Error.
 This indicates a fusing assembly malfunction. 
 Note: Chronic fuser failures or fuser overheating or both are indicators of an uninterruptible power supply or battery backup being used with the printer. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) should notbe used with the printer."
Remedy;"1. Unplug the printer for 10 minutes or more.
 2. Verify that the fuser connector is firmly seated in J102 of the DC Controller PCA and that the thermistor connector (left of fusing assembly) is seated into both the printer chassis and J206 of the DC Controller PCA.
 3. Remove the connector from J102 of the DC Controller (See Figure 6-14). Measure the resistance between pins one and two of the cable. (This procedure will measure the continuity of the ceramic heating element.) Normal resistance is 30 ohms +/-10 ohms. If no resistance is measured, replace the heating element.
 4. Remove the thermistor (temperature feedback) connector (See Figure 7-3). Measure the resistance between pins one and two. Normal resistance is 440K ohms +/- 30K at 20 degrees C. If the resistance is not measured replace the heating element.
 5. If the resistance readings are correct, yet the error persists, replace the DC Controller."

Description;"Beam Error
 There are a number of causes for this error, and some of the causes may be transient. (They may disappear.)"
Remedy;"1. Power-cycle the printer by unplugging the printer and plugging it back in.
 2. Make certain the Laser/Scanner Assembly is correctly seated on the printer chassis.
 3. Replace the Laser/Scanner cable (J208 on the DC Controller).
 4. Replace the Laser/Scanner Assembly.
 5. Replace the DC Controller PCA."

Description;"Engine Error.
 The formatter and engine are not communicating."
Remedy;"1. Power-cycle the printer by unplugging the printer and plugging it back in. If this doesn’t clear the error:
 2. Reseat Formatter to DC Controller PCA.
 3. Replace the Formatter PCA
 4. Replace the DC Controller PCA."

Description;"Scanner Error.
 Caused by a scanner malfunction."
Remedy;"1. Power-cycle the printer by unplugging the printer and plugging it back in.
 2. Ensure condensation caused by moving the printer from a cold to a warm environment hasn’t occurred. Allow the printer to acclimate to the warmer room.
 3. Verify the two Laser/Scanner Assembly connectors are firmly seated.
 4. Replace scanner cable J207 on the DC Controller PCA.
 5. Replace the Laser/Scanner Assembly.
 6. Replace the DC Controller PCA."

Description;Formatter Error.
Remedy;"1. Power-cycle the printer by unplugging the printer and plugging it back in. 
 2. Disconnect the parallel I/O cable and try running a printer self test. Reconnect the parallel cable if the self test is successful and try host/printer communications again.
 3. If the error persists, replace the Formatter PCA."
