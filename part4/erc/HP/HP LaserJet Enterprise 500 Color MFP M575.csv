Remedy;1. The product initializes and the 59.00.F0 Error displays (the product is unable to print). This error might be caused by one of the following conditions: • ITB is stuck and cannot rotate • Sensor SR17 (primary transfer-roller-disengagement) is defective 2. Make sure that the ITB is correctly installed. Turn the product off, and then on. 3. Manually test the ITB alienation sensor (SR17). Remove the ITB, and then rotate the gear (callout 1) to move the flag (callout 2). If the flag does not actuate, replace the ITB. 4. If the ITB flag is broken or damaged, replace the ITB (CC468-67907). Otherwise, continue with the next step. 5. Open the right door and defeat the interlock switch. With the ITB removed, perform the ITB Contact/Alienation test using the following steps. a. Press the Menu button. b. Press the Menu button again. c. Press the down arrow button to highlight the Component test item, and then touch the OK button. d. Press the down arrow button to highlight the ITB/Contact/Alienation item, and then touch the OK button. During the test (which takes about 20 seconds), observe the alienation drive hub (located above the cyan cartridge). If the alienation drive hub does not rotate, the problem might be the fuser motor or the fuser-drive assembly. The fuser motor is included in the fuser drive assembly. e. If the test is successful, the message Exit Diagnostics displays on the control panel. Touch the OK button, and then continu to the next step. Run the ITB Contact/Alienation test and observe the alienation drive hub, which is above the cyan cartridge. If the alienation hub does not rotate, the problem could be the fuser motor or the fuserdrive assembly. 6. Use the Manual Sensor Test to test SR17. Open the following menus: • Administration • Troubleshooting • Diagnostic Tests • Manual Sensor Test Observe the state of sensor I on the control panel. The normal state is 0. Insert a piece of paper into the SR17 sensor bracket. The state of the sensor on the control panel should change to 1. 7. Replace the sensor (SR17). NOTE: You do not need to replace the entire rear pre-exposure assembly to replace SR17. Order part number WG8-5696-000CN, Photo interrupter. To replace the see the following procedure. Remove and replace SR17 1. Turn the product off, remove the black and cyan toner cartridges, fuser, and the ITB. TIP: Make sure that there is sufficient light inside the product to see the sensor. If the error persists, contact your global business unit (BGU) to escalate the problem.
