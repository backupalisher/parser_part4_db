Code;49.XXXX
Display;49.XXXX PRINTER ERROR
Description;A critical firmware error has occurred that caused the processor on the formatter to abort operation. This type of error can be caused by invalid print commands, corrupt data, or invalid operations. In some cases, electrical noise in the cable can corrupt data during transmission to the printer. Other causes include poor quality parallel cables, poor connections, or homegrown applications. On rare occasions, the formatter is at fault, which is usually indicated by a 79 Service Error.
Remedy;1. Press CANCEL JOB to clear the print job from the printer memory. 2. Turn the printer off and then back on. 3. Try printing a job from a different software application. If the job prints, go back to the first application and try printing a different file. If the message appears only with a certain software application or print job, contact the software vendor for assistance. 4. If the message persists with different software applications and print jobs, disconnect all cables to the printer that connect it to the network or PC. 5. Turn the printer off. 6. Remove all memory DIMMs or third-party DIMMs from the printer. (Do not remove the firmware DIMM in slot J1.) 7. Remove all EIO devices from the printer. 8. Turn the printer on. 9.
