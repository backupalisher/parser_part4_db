Run a set of internal pages: • Are all of the 13.B2.Dx errors from the same paper tray • How often are they occurring Try to recreate the error: • Using the Event log, determine which tray(s) the error is occurring from then run single sided copies from that tray to try to recreate the error. • Replace the feed, Pickup and separation rollers for paper trays with errors. • Adjust the paper tray guides and load the paper according to procedure stated at the end of this document. Make sure that the tray width and length guides are set to the correct paper size being installed into the tray and that the tray is not over filled above fill mark on tray. • Try to recreate the error again, using that same tray. • If error still occurs, then continue to the troubleshooting section of this document before removing the jammed paper from the printer. 1. 1. Open the top cover and MP door and remove the toner cartridge to expose the paper path at the registration area. Inspect the paper path, take note as to where any paper and the paper’s leading edge is located and if simplex or duplex job was being run. Also inspect the leading edge of the paper for any signs of the paper catching on something. 2. If the leading edge of the paper closest to the registration assembly is past PS103 then the problem is most likely with the sensing of the paper with PS103 3. Use Manual sensor test to verify consistent operation of the Registration TOP sensor. Administration Troubleshooting Diagnostic Test Manual Sensor Test Scroll down until PS103 TOP is displayed When activating PS103 sensor, watch the control panel display for the sensor state to change from green to clear or clear to green. I might take a few seconds to change as you toggle sensor flag.

Display;13.B2.FF Paper Jam
Description;Residual paper jam in the registration area. This jam occurs when residual paper is detected at the registration sensor (PS103) at power on.
Remedy;1. Open the top cover and clear the jam in the indicated area. Inspect the paper path and make sure no paper is blocking the paper path. 2. Make sure that the tray width and length guides are set to the correct paper size being installed into the tray and that the tray is not over filled above fill mark on tray. 3. Test printer from other trays to verify functionality and if issue is specific to a one specific tray. 4. Try flossing the printer through the jam access door. • Place paper in access door. • Turn off then back on printer. • Watch for Page to be pulled into printer and fed through paper path. 5. Verify if print job was being duplexed. 6. Check if the pre-registration roller is dirty, worn or deformed. Clean the pre-registration roller if dirty. Replace the roller if it is worn or deformed. 7. Check the registration assembly. Verify the spring of the registration is in correct position. Replace the registration assembly if the registration shutter is scarred or worn. 8. Check and reconnect the connector (J94) on the DC controller PCA.

Code;49.XX.YY
Display;49.XX.YY Error
Description;A firmware error occurred. Corrupted print jobs, software application issues, non-product specific print drivers, poor quality USB or network cables, bad network connections or incorrect configurations, invalid firmware operations, or unsupported accessories can cause this error.
Remedy;1. Turn the product off, and then on. 2. If the error persists, check the following: • The error might be caused by a network connectivity problem, such as a bad interface cable, a bad USB port, or an invalid network configuration setting. • The error might be caused by the print job, due to an invalid print driver, a problem with the software application, or a problem with the file being printed. • Upgrading the product firmware might help resolve the error. See the product user guide for more information. When a 49 error occurs, the user sees a 49.XXXX message on the control panel (where XXXX is replaced by a combination of letters and numbers). A 49 error might happen at any time for multiple reasons. Although some types of 49 errors can be caused by hardware failures, it is more common for 49 errors to be caused by printing a specific document or performing some task on the product. 49 errors most often occur when a product is asked to perform an action that the product firmware is not capable of and might not have been designed to comply with, such as: • Printing files with unsupported programming commands • A unique combination of user environment and user interactions with the product • Interfacing with a third-party solution that was not designed to work with the product • Specific timing, network traffic, or concurrent processing of jobs Each of these interactions could cause the product firmware to initiate an action that the product cannot accomplish. In situations like this, the product might present the error if it has no other option. When these errors occur, the only way to recover is to turn the product`s power off and back on. NOTE: LaserJet formatter PCAs are rarely the root cause of 49 service errors. Please do not replace the formatter or flash unless troubleshooting has identified the formatter as the root cause. If the error persists, continue troubleshooting with the flowcharts for either Intermittent or Persistent 49 error troubleshooting (whichever is appropriate) in document c03122817, ?gHP LaserJet FutureSmart Devices - 49 Error Troubleshooting (Persistent and Intermittent)
