 When a 10.20.YY or 10.30.YY error occurs, a question mark is placed on the gas gauge of the supply or supplies with the error. These errors are noted in the event log and NON HP SUPPLY IN USE appears on the control panel. If multiple supplies have this error, a 10.XX.YY error is displayed for the first supply detected with the error. When the error corresponding to the first supply is resolved, another 10.XX.YY error is displayed for the next supply. This continues for all of the supplies errors. Note The consumables gas gauge and supplies status menu are always updated to indicate all supplies with a supplies memory error, even though the message refers to a single supply. Note 00 = memory data error might be caused when using non-HP supplies."
Remedy;"1 In the instance of 10.00, 10.20 and 10.30 errors, check if refilled cartridges or drums are used. Replace them with HP consumables. Note If a drum or cartridge reached a “low” or “out” condition and was moved to a different printer, it might be reported as a NON HP SUPPLY. 2 Turn the printer off, and then turn the printer on again to possibly clear the error. 3 Replace the indicated supply. 4 Check the print cartridge or image drum e-label indicator for damage. Replace the print cartridge or the image drum if necessary. 5 For print cartridges, check: • connectors J16, J17, J18, and J19 on the antenna PCAs. • connectors J1001, J1006, J1007, J1008, and J1009 on the memory controller PCA. • connector J802 on the T driver PCA. 6 For image drums, check: • connectors J12, J13, J14, and J15 on the antenna PCAs. • connectors J1001, J1002, J1003, J1004, and J1005 on the memory controller PCA. • connector J802 on the T driver PCA. 7 Replace the antenna PCA for the indicated cartridge or drum. 8 Replace the T driver PCA. 9 Replace the DC controller PCA
 In the instance of a 10.90.YY error, the image drum is reporting toner concentration-to-carrier is very low. This error might occur when non-HP supplies are used. Make sure that the toner delivery system and shutters are functioning correctly."

Description;The printer 54 errors indicate sensor abnormalities. Sensor abnormalities are caused by failed or blocked sensors, or sensors reporting results outside an expected range. Note Some 54 errors do not stop the printing process, and are only noted in the event log but not on the control panel. XX description 00 = ITB misalignment (check the event log for a 54.27 error and cycle power to recover) 01 = environmental temperature sensor output is abnormal (appears only in the event log) 05 = OHT sensor failure (appears only in the event log) 06 = density sensor failure Note For errors 11 through 14, the density is set to the highest or lowest possible value. This usually occurs because the calibration patches are not on the ITB correctly. These errors appear only in the event log. 11 = yellow density sensor (the engine detects abnormality in the yellow density control and the engine default is used) 12 = magenta density sensor (the engine detects abnormality in the magenta density control and the engine default is used) 13 = cyan density sensor (the engine detects abnormality in the cyan density control and the engine default is used) 14 = black density sensor (the engine detects abnormality in the black density control and the engine default is used) Note Errors 15 through 18 only appear in the event log and printing continues. 15 = yellow CPR sensor (the engine cannot detect the yellow CPR pattern on the ITB) 16 = magenta CPR sensor (the engine cannot detect the magenta CPR pattern on the ITB) 17 = cyan CPR sensor (the engine cannot detect the cyan CPR pattern on the ITB) 18 = black CPR sensor (the engine cannot detect the black CPR pattern on the ITB) 20 = CPR sensor (output is abnormal or the engine cannot detect any of the CPR patterns on the ITB) Note Errors 21 through 24 indicate a toner concentration sensor failure. 21 = yellow image drum t/d ratio sensor 22 = magenta image drum t/d ratio sensor 23 = cyan image drum t/d ratio sensor 24 = black image drum t/d ratio sensor 27 = ITB misalignment sensor Note 27 = ITB misalignment sensor appears in the event log, but it might appear as a 54.00 error on the control panel. 28 = clean density/CPR sensor warning (only appears in the event log) Note For error 28, the CLEAN SENSORS 54.28.01 (density sensor is dirty) or CLEAN SENSORS 54.28.02 (CPR sensor is dirty) appears on the event log. 29 = clean density/CPR sensor failed (only appears in the event log and CLEAN SENSORS appears on the control panel) 30 = halftone calibration error .
