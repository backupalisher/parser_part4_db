In this case it is a sign of a worn out fuser. • The paper jam is found underneath the toner cartridge or in the transfer area. In this case it could be the drum drive or the white collar that holds the toner cartridge in position has broken or even a damaged or defective toner cartridge. • Fuser drive or delivery issue. 1. Determine where the Jam is located. 2. Open top cover and check under the toner cartridge. 3. Open rear output bin and check for media or obstructions. Media stopped in the Toner/transfer area (Stopped BEFORE the Fuser): 1. Open top cover and check under toner cartridge for media or obstructions. 2. Ensure the Toner Cartridge and Transfer Roller are seated properly. If damaged replace toner cartridge or transfer roller. 3. Check the toner cartridge guides and the transfer roller assembly, If either are damaged elevate the issue to HP for possible printer replacement. 4. Inspect the white plastic collar that cradles the drum cartridge that is positioned around the drum drive gear. If the collar portion is broken and missing a section it will allow the cartridge to insert further than designed and not allow the drum drive to engage with the toner cartridge. elevate the issue to HP for possible printer replacement. 5. If collar is not broken, Test the drum drive motor M102 using the diagnostic test. If test fails, elevate the issue to HP for possible printer replacement. Media Stopped In or At the Fuser CAUTION: The fuser might be HOT. 1. Remove the Fuser and inspect Fuser sleeve, Pressure roller and delivery roller for blockage and/or damage.

Description;The printer detected a different paper size than expected. Y = Type, Z = Tray • Y = 0 Size mismatch. Detected media is longer or shorter than expected. • Y = A Size mismatch. Detected media too long. • Y = B Size mismatch. Detected media too short. • Y = C Size mismatch. Inter-page gap error. • Z = D Source is the duplexer. • Z = E Source is the envelope feeder. • Z = 1 Source is Tray 1. • Z = 2 Source is Tray 2. • Z = 3 Source is Tray 3. • Z = 4 Source is Tray 4. • Z = 5 Source is Tray 5.
Remedy;1. Touch OK to use another tray.2. Print a configuration page to verify the size and type to which the trays are set.3. Make sure that the tray is loaded with the correct paper size and that the sliding paper guides are correctly adjusted to the correct paper size.4. Verify that the error is not occurring as a result of an unexpected paper size trigger caused by a multi-page feed. 5. Print internal pages from all trays to verify that this error only occurs when printing from the PC.6. Verify that the Toner cartridge and the transfer roller are seated properly.7. Check the rollers and make sure they are not worn smooth, or coated with paper dust or other debris. If the rollers are causing the issue, send the customer a roller kit.8. Use the Tray/Bin manual sensor test to verify that the cassette media switch is correctly functioning.9. Check paper path sensors for proper operation and that they do not stick at all. If issue persists, levate issue for printer replacement.10. Reconnect the connectors for the media sensor, intermediate-transfer belt, and the DC controller PCA.11. Test registration assembly motor and clutch. If not function properly replace the registration assembly. If the error persists, elevate issue for printer replacement.

Description;A firmware error occurred. Corrupted print jobs, software application issues, non-product specific print drivers, poor quality USB or network cables, bad network connections or incorrect configurations, invalid firmware operations, or unsupported accessories can cause this error.
Remedy;1. Turn the product off, and then on. 2. If the error persists, check the following: • The error might be caused by a network connectivity problem, such as a bad interface cable, a bad USB port, or an invalid network configuration setting. • The error might be caused by the print job, due to an invalid print driver, a problem with the software application, or a problem with the file being printed. • Upgrading the product firmware might help resolve the error. See the product user guide for more information. When a 49 error occurs, the user sees a 49.XXXX message on the control panel (where XXXX is replaced by a combination of letters and numbers). A 49 error might happen at any time for multiple reasons. Although some types of 49 errors can be caused by hardware failures, it is more common for 49 errors to be caused by printing a specific document or performing some task on the product. 49 errors most often occur when a product is asked to perform an action that the product firmware is not capable of and might not have been designed to comply with, such as: • Printing files with unsupported programming commands • A unique combination of user environment and user interactions with the product • Interfacing with a third-party solution that was not designed to work with the product • Specific timing, network traffic, or concurrent processing of jobs Each of these interactions could cause the product firmware to initiate an action that the product cannot accomplish. In situations like this, the product might present the error if it has no other option. When these errors occur, the only way to recover is to turn the product`s power off and back on. NOTE: LaserJet formatter PCAs are rarely the root cause of 49 service errors. Please do not replace the formatter or flash unless troubleshooting has identified the formatter as the root cause. If the error persists, continue troubleshooting with the flowcharts for either Intermittent or Persistent 49 error troubleshooting (whichever is appropriate) in document c03122817, ВЃgHP LaserJet FutureSmart Devices - 49 Error Troubleshooting (Persistent and Intermittent)ВЃh.

Description;The product has experienced an internal embedded software error. Under most conditions, the product automatically restarts.
Remedy;"1. Reset the printer: a. Turn off the power by using the power switch, and then wait at least 30 seconds. b. Turn on the power and wait for the product to initialize. 2. If you are using a surge protector: a. Power off the printer. b. Remove the surge protector. c. Plug the product directly into the wall socket and turn the product power on. 3. If the error persists, disconnect any network or USB cables and power cycle. If the product returns to Ready, check the FW version and update if a newer version is available. 4. If the error persists, print a Service Page from the Reports menu. Also, print an Error Report from the 2ndary Service Menu. On the Service Page, look at the xxxx portion of the 49.xxxx errors listed: • If the numbers are all or mostly different, then power quality is a possible problem; try a different wall socket. • If the xxxx portion of 49.xxxx contain repeats of the same numbers or groups of numbers, then check the 2ndary Service Error Report printed earlier for indications of a failure in a particular area. The report may indicate whether the error is caused by a network problem or a problem with the job. 5. If the error persists, replace the product. NOTE: If the 49 Error is caused by the network or a specific file, do not replace the product; it will not resolve the issue. Instead, attempt to isolate the issue in a way that demonstrates the error is caused by something in the environment. 6. If the error persists after product replacement, escalate to Level 3 so that Technical Marketing has visibility to the problem."
