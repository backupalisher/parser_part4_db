Code;49.XXXX
Display;49.XXXX PRINTER ERROR
Description;A critical firmware error has occurred that caused the processor on the formatter to abort operation. This type of error can be caused by invalid print commands, corrupt data, or invalid operations. In some cases, electrical noise in the cable can corrupt data during transmission to the printer. Other causes include poorquality parallel cables, poorconnections, or home-grown programs. On rare occasions, the formatter is at fault, which is usually indicated by a 79 Service Error.
Remedy;1 Press CANCEL JOB to clear the print job from the printer memory. 2 Turn the printer off and then on. 3 Try printing a job from a different software program. If the job prints, go back to the first program and try printing a different file. If the message appears only with a certain software program or print job, contact the software vendor for assistance. 4 If the message persists with different software programs and print jobs, disconnect all of the cables to the printer that connect it to the network or computer. 5 Turn the printer off. 6 Remove all memory DIMMs or third-party DIMMs from the printer. 7 Remove all EIO devices from the printer. 8 Turn the printer on. 9 If the error no longer exists, install each DIMM and EIO device one at a time, making sure to turn the printer off and on again as you install each device. 10 Replace a DIMM or EIO device if you determine that it causes the error. 11 Remember to reconnect all of the cables that connect the printer to the network or computer. 12 If the error persists, replace the firmware DIMM. 13 Replace the formatter and calibrate the printer.
