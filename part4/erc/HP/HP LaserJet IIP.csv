Display;11 Paper Out
Description;"Paper tray empty or not seated correctly. A buildup of toner on the edges of the tray which slide into the printer can sometimes cause problems. Take a sharp tool, like a razor blade and scrape the buildup off these edges.
 Sensor Arm Stuck or Broken - check for free movement of the sensor arm.
 Defective Tray Size Sensing or Configuration - Most trays have tabs which depress a series of switches when installed. Verify that the tabs aren`t damaged and that the tray switches located in the printer are not damaged. You can depress these by hand and hear them click. Occasionally the contact for the micro switch will get bent and will have to be replaced. Also verify the configuration through the menus on the printer.
 Defective Paper Control Sensor PCB - These do fail and will need to be replaced."
Code;12
Display;12 Printer Open
Description;Paper path door or top cover open. On the this can be caused by a defective toner cartridge, defective cooling fan, PS4 or PS5 sensors. Also caused by the density adjusting PCA located behind the density adjusting slide switch. This board takes the input from the two sensors and provides info to the DC controller. If the board becomes defective, you will receive an error 12. Easily replaced after removing the top cover and three wiring harness connectors. If you want to attempt board level repair try the electrolytic capacitor, C702, 10 uF 50 VDC.

Display;13 Paper Jam
Description;"Check the paper, make sure it meets the paper specifications for your printer. Tractor feed paper with the edges ripped off doesn`t seem to work very well. Extremely heavy or thick paper is also a problem. Check the HP paper specification guide for more info. Be careful with labels, use only labels designed to take the heat generated by the fuser assembly. Regular labels my ""ooze"" adhesive as they pass through the fuser assembly and literally gum up the works! Also check for any partially peeled labels, this can be a disaster if they come off inside the printer. Check the paper path for toner or paper dust buildup. Look for bits of paper lodged in the path particularly around the sensors."

Description;"This indicates a communication problem between the formatter PCA and an optional interface installed (such as a network card). Remove and reseat the optional interface card. If the problem continues, remove the optional interface card and set the printer for standard parallel interface by taking off-line and holding down ""Menu"" key for 5-10 seconds. Scroll through items until ""I/O ="" appears and use the +/- key to display parallel and the enter key to select. Then put the printer back online and send a test job from the host computer via the parallel cable. If this is successful, you have a problem with the optional I/O card and should replace it or reset it."
