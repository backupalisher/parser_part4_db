Description;The product has experienced an internal embedded software error. Under most conditions, the product automatically restarts.
Causes;
Remedy;"1. Reset the printer: a. Turn off the power by using the power switch, and then wait at least 30 seconds. b. Turn on the power and wait for the product to initialize. 2. If you are using a surge protector: a. Power off the printer. b. Remove the surge protector. c. Plug the product directly into the wall socket and turn the product power on. 3. If the error persists, disconnect any network or USB cables and power cycle. If the product returns to Ready, check the FW version and update if a newer version is available. 4. If the error persists, print a Service Page from the Reports menu. Also, print an Error Report from the 2ndary Service Menu. On the Service Page, look at the xxxx portion of the 49.xxxx errors listed: • If the numbers are all or mostly different, then power quality is a possible problem; try a different wall socket. • If the xxxx portion of 49.xxxx contain repeats of the same numbers or groups of numbers, then check the 2ndary Service Error Report printed earlier for indications of a failure in a particular area. The report may indicate whether the error is caused by a network problem or a problem with the job. 5. If the error persists, replace the product. NOTE: If the 49 Error is caused by the network or a specific file, do not replace the product; it will not resolve the issue. Instead, attempt to isolate the issue in a way that demonstrates the error is caused by something in the environment. 6. If the error persists after product replacement, escalate to Level 3 so that Technical Marketing has visibility to the problem."
