Code;49.XXXXX
Display;49.XXXXX ERROR To continue turn off then on
Description;A critical firmware error has occurred. This type of error can be caused by invalid print commands, corrupt data, or invalid firmware operations. NOTE In many cases, turning the power off and then on will permanently clear most 49 errors. In some instances, electrical noise in the cable can corrupt data during transmission to the device. Other causes include poor-quality USB cables, poor connections, or specific software programs. Sometimes, the formatter is at fault, which is usually indicated by a 79 Error message. NOTE In most cases, replacing the formatter will not remedy repetitive 49 errors. Very rarely the formatter hardware may be faulty which will be indicated by a 79 Error message.
Remedy;1. Turn the MFP off, and then turn the MFP on. NOTE Turning the power off and then on will clear most 49 errors. 2. Upgrade the firmware. 3. Try printing a job from a different software program. If the job prints, go back to the first program and try printing a different file. If the message appears only with a certain software program or print job, contact the software vendor for assistance. 4. Do the following: a. If the message persists when using different software programs and attempting specific print jobs, disconnect all of the cables that connect the MFP to the network or a computer. b. Turn the MFP off. c. Remove the DIMM. d. Remove any installed EIO devices. e. Turn the device on. f.

Remedy;1. Remove the indicated tray to see if the message changes. Also, make sure that all of the shipping tape or inserts have been removed. 2. Install the tray and listen carefully. You should be able to hear the paper stack being lifted. You can also watch the paper-level indicator on the front of the tray to see if it moves. 3. Make sure that the tray lift sensor flag is functioning correctly. Replace the tray if necessary. 4. For Tray 2 and Tray 3, verify that connector J324 on the dc controller PCA is firmly seated. This connector is for the Tray 2 and Tray 3 lift motors and sensor/ switch assemblies. 5. For Trays 4, 5, or 6, verify that connector J1505 on the corresponding HCI PCA (one PCA for each tray) is firmly seated. Also check J1506 on the corresponding HCI PCA (sensor connector). Make sure to check the correct connector on the associated HCI PCA for the 3 x 500- sheet feeder. 6. If the lift motor for that tray is not functional, first verify that nothing is obstructing its movement. Replace the lifter driver assembly for the tray if necessary
