Display;11 Paper Out
Description;"Paper tray empty or not seated correctly. A buildup of toner on the edges of the tray which slide into the printer can sometimes cause problems. Take a sharp tool, like a razor blade and scrape the buildup off these edges.
 Sensor Arm Stuck or Broken - check for free movement of the sensor arm.
 Defective Paper Control Sensor PCB - These do fail and will need to be replaced."

Display;12 Printer Open
Description;Paper path door open. This board takes the input from the two sensors and provides info to the DC controller. If the board becomes defective, you will receive an error 12. Easily replaced after removing the top cover and three wiring harness connectors. If you want to attempt board level repair try the electrolytic capacitor, C702, 10 uF 50 VDC.
Code;13
Display;13 Paper Jam
Description;"Check the paper, make sure it meets the paper specifications for your printer. Tractor feed paper with the edges ripped off doesn`t seem to work very well. Extremely heavy or thick paper is also a problem. Check the HP paper specification guide for more info. Be careful with labels, use only labels designed to take the heat generated by the fuser assembly. Regular labels my ""ooze"" adhesive as they pass through the fuser assembly and literally gum up the works! Also check for any partially peeled labels, this can be a disaster if they come off inside the printer.
 You could also have a defective or dirty exit sensor. Replace or clean as needed.
 Make sure the paper cassettes are installed correctly. A buildup of toner on the edges of the tray which slide into the printer can sometimes cause problems. Take a sharp tool, like a razor blade and scrape the buildup off these edges."

Description;"This indicates a communication problem between the formatter PCA and an optional interface installed (such as a network card). Remove and reseat the optional interface card. If the problem continues, remove the optional interface card and set the printer for standard parallel interface by taking off-line and holding down ""Menu"" key for 5-10 seconds. Scroll through items until ""I/O ="" appears and use the +/- key to display parallel and the enter key to select. Then put the printer back online and send a test job from the host computer via the parallel cable. If this is successful, you have a problem with the optional I/O card and should replace it or reset it."
