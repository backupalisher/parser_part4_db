If any of these components is dirty or worn, replace the component. The ADF-input motor might be defective. Observe the motor to see if it is rotating or attempting to pull paper through the paper path. You can use the scanner tests (Troubleshooting > Scanner Tests) to test this motor. Run the ADF input motor test and the ADF input motor reverse test. If the motor does not rotate, verify that the connector CN103 is seated correctly on the scanner-controller PCA and that the connector on the motor is seated correctly. If the motor is defective, replace the ADF.
