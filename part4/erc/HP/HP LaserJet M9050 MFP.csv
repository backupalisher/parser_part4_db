Description;"A critical firmware error has occurred. This type of error can be caused by invalid print commands, corrupt data, or invalid firmware operations. In many cases, turning the product off and turning it on permanently clears the error, and the product continues without issues. In some cases, electrical noise over the cables can corrupt data during transmission. Faulty USB cables, poor connections, and specific software issues can also cause these errors. The formatter can also cause these errors; however such an error is usually a 79 code. Replacing the formatter rarely solves repetitive 49 errors."
Remedy;- Turn the product off, and then on. - Upgrade the firmware. - Try printing from a different software application to determine whether the application is causing the problem. Go back to the original application an try printing a different file. If the problem seems to be with the software application, contact the vender. Try the following actions: 1. Disconnect all connections to networks and computers. 2. Turn the product off. 3. Remove the DIMM. 4. Remove all EIO devices. 5. Turn the product on. 6. If error disappears, reinstall the EIO devices one at a time to see if the error returns (turn the product off, install the EIO device, and turn it on). If the error returns replace the faulty EIO device. 7. If the error still does not reappear, reconnect each connection to computers or networks until the error reappears. 8.
