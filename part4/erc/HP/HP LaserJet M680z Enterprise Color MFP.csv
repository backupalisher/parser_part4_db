Display;31.01.02 Jam in document feeder
Description;‘Jam in document feeder’ occurs when a page is picked, but gets jammed somewhere inside the document feeder.
Remedy;1. Check the ADF float to verify it is properly positioned a. Push on the float. If properly installed it should spring back. If it does not, verify the latch at the top is snapped into position. b. Check the location of the small Mylar tabs. If the tabs are blocking the paper path, push gently on the tab to place it in the proper position behind the white foam reflector 2. If the 30.01.02 message cannot be cleared, a sensor might still be blocked by a piece of paper. There are two other sensors used to detect media jammed in the document feeder. Continue with the following troubleshooting. Troubleshooting the internal jam sensors There are two other sensors that need to be checked when a 31.01.02 is persistent. The feed sensor is located in the paper path just before the ADF float. The exit sensor is located just after the ADF float. A business card can be used to “flush” the area around the sensors to determine if a scrap of paper or possibly a paper clip is causing a false jam indication. If either sensor is found defective, the ADF must be replaced. a. Open the ADF top cover and insert a business card from above to clear the feed sensor. b. Insert a business card from below to clear the exit sensor.

Display;31.01.03 Document feeder pick error
Description;The document feeder pick (or mis-pick) error occurs when a page cannot be fed from the input tray.
Remedy;1. Verify that the roller assembly and separation pad are installed correctly. a. Open the top cover of the ADF. b. Push down on the separation pad, and then release it. It should spring back up. If it does not, the spring might be missing. NOTE: The separation pad assembly is mounted to a spring loaded paper access guide, which also moves when pushed down. c. Close the ADF top cover while observing the roller assembly. It will fall against the separation pad, and then pop up when the ADF initializes. 2. Clean the separation pad and rollers. Use a soft, lint-free cloth moistened with water to clean the two rollers and the separation pad. 3. Print a Supplies Status page and verify the remaining life of the Document Feeder Kit. if the remaining life is less than 10%, explain to the customer that the rollers and separation pad are consumables and need to be replaced every 90K pages. 4. Check the stack height in the tray. If the stack height is greater than 7 mm (0.28 in), the originals might get jammed under the feed guides. 5. Verify that the feed guides are not pushed too tightly against the input stack. 6. Check the operation of the registration sensor flag. a. Open the top cover and locate the sensor flag. b. Push down on the flag, and then release it. It should spring back into position. If it does not spring back into position, replace the ADF. c. Close the top cover. 7. Check the input tray. If the clear plastic edge of the input tray is always illuminated with green light, even without paper in the tray, proceed with the following troubleshooting steps. Troubleshooting the internal jam sensors The green LED in the input tray is always on, even when no paper is present. This condition will cause the ADF to continue to pick, even after all the pages have left the input tray. a. Check the ADF ground wire connection at the rear of the scanner. b. If the ground wire is in contact with the CN10 connector test point of the SCB, loosen the screw and move the wire away from the CN10. If the ground wire contacts the CN10 connector test point of the SCB, the formatter will be damaged, resulting in a persistent (will not clear) 31.01.03 document feeder pick error. NOTE: The formatter will have to be replaced. The grounding of the test point results in damage to a component on the formatter, which results in a loss of 3.3v to the SCB.

Code;49.XX.YY
Display;49.XX.YY Error To continue turn off then on
Description;A firmware error occurred. Corrupted print jobs, software application issues, non-product specific print drivers, poor quality USB or network cables, bad network connections or incorrect configurations, invalid firmware operations, or unsupported accessories can cause this error.
Remedy;1. Turn the product off, and then on. 2. If the error persists, check the following: • The error might be caused by a network connectivity problem, such as a bad interface cable, a bad USB port, or an invalid network configuration setting. • The error might be caused by the print job, due to an invalid print driver, a problem with the software application, or a problem with the file being printed. • Upgrading the product firmware might help resolve the error. See the product user guide for more information. When a 49 error occurs, the user sees a 49.XXXX message on the control panel (where XXXX is replaced by a combination of letters and numbers). A 49 error might happen at any time for multiple reasons. Although some types of 49 errors can be caused by hardware failures, it is more common for 49 errors to be caused by printing a specific document or performing some task on the product. 49 errors most often occur when a product is asked to perform an action that the product firmware is not capable of and might not have been designed to comply with, such as: • Printing files with unsupported programming commands • A unique combination of user environment and user interactions with the product • Interfacing with a third-party solution that was not designed to work with the product • Specific timing, network traffic, or concurrent processing of jobs Each of these interactions could cause the product firmware to initiate an action that the product cannot accomplish. In situations like this, the product might present the error if it has no other option. When these errors occur, the only way to recover is to turn the product`s power off and back on. NOTE: LaserJet formatter PCAs are rarely the root cause of 49 service errors. Please do not replace the formatter or flash unless troubleshooting has identified the formatter as the root cause. If the error persists, continue troubleshooting with the flowcharts for either Intermittent or Persistent 49 error troubleshooting (whichever is appropriate) in document c03122817, “HP LaserJet FutureSmart Devices - 49 Error Troubleshooting (Persistent and Intermittent)”.
