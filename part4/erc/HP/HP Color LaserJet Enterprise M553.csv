Code;49.XX.YY
Display;49.XX.YY Error To continue turn off then on
Description;A firmware error occurred. Corrupted print jobs, software application issues, non-product specific print drivers, poor quality USB or network cables, bad network connections or incorrect configurations, invalid firmware operations, or unsupported accessories can cause this error.
Remedy;1. Turn the printer off, and then on. 2. If the error persists, check the following: • The error might be caused by a network connectivity problem, such as a bad interface cable, a bad USB port, or an invalid network configuration setting. • The error might be caused by the print job, due to an invalid print driver, a problem with the software application, or a problem with the file being printed. • Upgrading the printer firmware might help resolve the error. See the printer user guide for more information. When a 49 error occurs, the user sees a 49.XXXX message on the control panel (where XXXX is replaced by a combination of letters and numbers). A 49 error might happen at any time for multiple reasons. Although some types of 49 errors can be caused by hardware failures, it is more common for 49 errors to be caused by printing a specific document or performing some task on the product. 49 errors most often occur when a product is asked to perform an action that the product firmware is not capable of and might not have been designed to comply with, such as: • Printing files with unsupported programming commands • A unique combination of user environment and user interactions with the product • Interfacing with a third-party solution that was not designed to work with the product • Specific timing, network traffic, or concurrent processing of jobs Each of these interactions could cause the product firmware to initiate an action that the product cannot accomplish. In situations like this, the product might present the error if it has no other option. When these errors occur, the only way to recover is to turn the product`s power off and back on. NOTE: LaserJet formatter PCAs are rarely the root cause of 49 service errors. Please do not replace the formatter or flash unless troubleshooting has identified the formatter as the root cause.
