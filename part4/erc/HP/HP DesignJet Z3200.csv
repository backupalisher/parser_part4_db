Description;Problem with paper advance. This source of error could come from an error in any of the following systems: paper motor, disk encoder, cables or main electronics.
Remedy;"Initial checks: This error can occur because the printer has been dropped during transportation, causing structural damage. Before continuing with the 81:YZ troubleshooting, first look for structural damage. To identify the structural damage, look for the following three things: • Consistent 81:YZ error codes. • Platen fingers rubbing on the roller surface, leaving black marks on the roller. • A gap on the platen beam. If there’s any gap in Z (vertical direction) between the plastic feature of the platen and the metal side plate, then the chassis is damaged and the unit cannot be repaired.  Corrective Action: • Open the Window and check for any visible obstacles restricting the movement of the Drive Roller. If there is a wrinkled mass of media inside the paper path, lift the Pinchwheels (using the Media Lever) and clear the obstruction. • Perform the Media Drive diagnostic test to troubleshoot the problem further. • Check the connections on the Main PCA; the Media Advance Drive is connected to the connector labeled Paper Motor. • Adjust the encoder disc and motor mount configuration .
