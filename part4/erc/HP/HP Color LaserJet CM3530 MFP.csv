Code;49.XXXXX
Display;49.XXXXX ERROR
Description;A firmware error has occurred. This type of error can be caused by corrupted print jobs or software program issues, non product-specific printer drivers, poor-quality USB or network cables, bad network connections or incorrect network configurations, invalid firmware operations, or unsupported accessories.
Remedy;The following steps should help to identify possible causes and a resolution to the error condition: 1. Turn the product off then on. If the error returns, disconnect all interface cables and turn the product off and then on again. If the error recurs only after connecting one of the interface cables or it happens randomly, go to step 2. If the error returns after the second time you turn the product off and on, follow these steps: a. The error has been isolated to when the product is in stand-alone condition. Turn the product off and remove the hard drive, fax card (if equipped), any HP paper-handling accessories, all third-party DIMMs (leave the minimum HP memory installed), and all third-party accessories. b. After you have removed all components, turn the product on and print a configuration page. If the configuration page prints, the error has been isolated to one or more components you removed. Go to step c. If the configuration page does not print, go to step e. c. Turn the product off, reinstall one of the components onto the formatter, and turn the product on. Print the configuration page after the individual component is added. d. Continue reinstalling one component at a time and printing the configuration page until you identify the faulty component. Replace the faulty component, or contact the third-party accessory supplier. e. If the configuration page did not print in step b, turn the product off and reinstall all components removed from the formatter. Reinstall the formatter. f. Perform a Cold Reset, Disk INIT and NVRAM INIT. NOTE: Customer settings or data from the disk might be lost. g. If the product does not come to a ready state after performing all steps listed above, contact your Hewlett Packard support center. NOTE: HP LaserJet formatter PCAs are rarely the cause of 49 service errors. Do not replace the formatter unless troubleshooting identifies it as the cause. 2. If the error clears after turning the product off and then on, it is possible that a print job, an action performed on the product, or a connectivity issue is responsible for the error. a. If the error recurs only after connecting an interface cable try the following actions, if applicable: • Try a new cable. • Move the product to a new network port, fax-line port, or USB port. • Verify that all unused network protocols are disabled and that all settings are correctly set for the network configuration being used. • Reset the fax settings to factory defaults. Configure only the basic settings needed to operate: country/ region, company name, and fax number. • Verify that the fax card firmware revision is the correct version for the formatter firmware version on the product. b. If the error happens only when performing certain actions, such as making a copy, sending an e-mail, or sending a fax, try the following actions, if applicable: • Try different configuration settings • Increase or decrease the file resolution • Use black and white file format instead of color, or vice-versa. • Use different file formats, for example .PDF or .TIFF. • Use different copy settings, such as eliminating duplex printing or printing multiple pages on one sheet. • Reduce the number of originals. • Reset the fax settings to factory defaults. Configure only the basic settings needed to operate: country/ region, company name, and fax number. • Verify that the fax card firmware revision is the correct version for the formatter firmware version on the product. c. If the error occurs only when printing a job, try the following actions: • Verify that the printer driver is correct for your product. • Try printing another file from the same software program or from another software program. • Reduce the number of features being used in the print job, such as printing watermarks, printing multiple pages on one sheet, or using job-storage features. • If other files or software programs are successful, try making changes to the file, such using different fonts, changing driver settings, or printing with another driver language, such as PCL 6. d. If the error continues to occur, update the product firmware. Obtain the latest firmware 3. If the error persists after performing these steps, contact your Hewlett Packard support center.
