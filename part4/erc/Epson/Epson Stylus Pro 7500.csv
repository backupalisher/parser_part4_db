Code;00000101
Description;"Ink Tube worn out
 A printer part has exceeded its useful life, and to prevent damage to other parts as well as abnormal operations/printouts, an error occurs. This error occurs when the CR Motor has reached 2.5 million passes, and this indicates the ink tubes should be replaced due to excessive wear and tear."
Remedy;To make sure the ink tubes are not worn out, verify no part of any of the tubes shows wear, is loose, or leaks ink anywhere, especially the tube area between the printheads and the ink pipes.
Code;00010000
Description;"PF motor encoder check error
 The PF motor makes small revolutions clockwise and counterclockwise. When it turns, the printer checks the rotary encoder (inside the motor) output signals to make sure the motor is turning at the correct speed/distance. If the encoder sends an incorrect signal, an error occurs."
Remedy;Make sure there is nothing blocking the grid rollers. If that does not solve the problem, check the PF motor encoder connection. If there still is a problem, try the following. • Check and adjust the PF Belt tension • Replace the PF motor • Replace the Main Board
Code;00010001
Description;"PF motor out of step
 PF motor out of step - the length of the PF motor internal encoder’s pulse is too long or too short compared to the regular pulse."
Remedy;Make sure there is nothing blocking the grid rollers. If that does not solve the problem, check the PF motor encoder connection. If there still is a problem, try the following. • Check and adjust the PF Belt tension • Replace the PF motor • Replace the Main Board
Code;00010002

Remedy;• Replace the PF motor • Replace the Main Board
Code;00010003
Description;"PF in-position time-out
 The in-position time is the amount of time the printer waits to make sure the carriage is not moving when the carriage comes to a stop. The rotary encoder is activate for the predetermined “in-position time” and if the encoder sends a pulse, this means the carriage is moving even though it is supposed to be at a full stop, this generates an error."
Remedy;• Replace the PF motor • Replace the Main Board
Code;00010004
Description;"CR motor encoder check error
 The CR motor makes small revolutions clockwise and counterclockwise. When it turns, the printer checks the encoder output signals to make sure the motor is turning at the correct speed/ distance. If the encoder doesn’t send the correct signal or output data, an error occurs."
Remedy;Make sure there is nothing blocking the carriage. If that does not solve the problem, check the CR motor encoder connection. If there still is a problem, try the following. • Check the plastic step ruler for soiled areas, obstructions, and damage • Make sure no foreign material or ink tubes (from pump assembly) are blocking the carriage path (see “Removing the Maintenance Assembly” on page 143 for reassembly points) • Replace the encoder sensor • Replace the CR motor • Replace the Main Board

Code;00010007
Description;"CR in-position time-out
 The in-position time is the amount of time the printer waits to make sure the carriage is not moving when the carriage comes to a stop. The linear encoder is activate for the predetermined “in-position time” and if the encoder sends a pulse, this means the carriage is moving even though it is supposed to be at a full stop, this generates an error."
Remedy;• Replace the encoder sensor • Replace the CR motor • Replace the Main Board
