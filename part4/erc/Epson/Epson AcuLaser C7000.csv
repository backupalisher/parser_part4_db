If an error still occurs after replacing, • With the tool: Go to step 3 • Without the tool: Go to step 4] • With the tool: Go to step 3 • Without the tool: Go to step 4 3 • Checking the LIFT MOTOR ASSY: Does the LIFT MOTOR ASSY function properly? . By using the diagnostics commander, check by Digital Output Test device code ""2D, 2E"". Go to step 6 Go to step 4 4 • Checking for continuity of REGI HARNESS ASSY: Is there normal continuity between J91B . J208? Go to step 5 Replace the REGI HARNESS ASSY. 5 • Checking for continuity of P/H HARNESS ASSY: Is there normal continuity between J20B . J91B? • With the tool: Go to step 6 • Without the tool: Go to step 7 Replace the P/H HARNESS ASSY. 6 • Checking the LEVEL SENSOR: Does the LEVEL SENSOR function properly? . By using the diagnostics commander, check by Digital Input Test device code ""2C"". Replace the MCU PWB-XL Go to step 7 7 • Checking for continuity of MSI HARNESS ASSY: Is there normal continuity between J201 . J209? Go to step 8 Replace the MSI HARNESS ASSY. 8 • Checking for continuity of P/H HARNESS ASSY: Is there normal continuity between J20A . J91A? Replace the MCU PWB-XL or LIFT MOTOR ASSY LEVEL SENSOR Replace the P/H HARNESS ASSY."
Code;998
Description;Engine communication error
Remedy;1 • Initial setting: • Remove all the optional units and modules related to the electrical system and bring the printer back to the standard status. • Check if all connectors are properly connected to the CONTROLLER PWB. • Reinsert the DIMM. Replace or reinstall the relevant part. Go to step 2 2 • Improving the CONTROLLER PWB Environment: • Update the program to the latest one in the DIMM.ÅB Replace or reinstall the relevant part. Go to step 3 3 • Replacing the CONTROLLER PWB and Performing Checks: Does the problem still occur after replacing the MCU PWB with a normal one? - Problem solved
