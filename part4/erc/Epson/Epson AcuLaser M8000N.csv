Code;E100
Description;"Exposure failure
 SOS signal cannot be detected at correct intervals. Output of laser beam does not reach the specified value."
Remedy;1. Remove Left Cover and check the connection and operation of SWITCH I/L ASSY (P/J144, P/J145). 2. The connectors on ROS ASSY are correctly connected? 3. Check the connections between ROS ASSY <=> MCU Board Assy. Disconnection/slant connection of a connector Disconnection/damage of a harness a connector. 4. Because INTERLOCK S/W 5V is not working, 5VDC is not supplied. Check the operation and connection of INTERLOCK S/W 5V (P/J142). 5. Replace ROS ASSY. 6. Replace MCU Board Assy.
Code;E300
Description;"Fusing failure
 Temperature of Heat Roller does not reach the specified value. Warming-up of Fuser Unit is not completed within the specified period. Thermistor detects an abnormally high temperature."
Remedy;1. Connectors on LVPS are connected correctly? 2. Check the connection between Fuser Unit <=> LVPS <=> MCU Board Assy. Disconnection/slant connection of a connector Disconnection/damage of a harness. 3. Replace Fuser Unit. 4. Replace MCU Board Assy.
Code;E500
Description;"MAIN MOTOR failure
 MOTOR ASSY is not turning, or not turning normally."
Remedy;1. Connectors on LVPS and MCU Board Assy are correctly connected? 2. Check the connections between MAIN MOTOR <=> LVPS <=> MCU Board Assy. Disconnection/slant connection of a connector Disconnection/damage of a harness. 3. MAIN MOTOR is not turning normally due to an abnormal load on it. Check GEAR ASSY HOUSING`s Drive Transmission Path. 4. Replace MAIN MOTOR. 5. Replace LVPS. 6. Replace MCU Board Assy.
Code;E550
Description;"Fan motor failure
 FAN MAIN does not rotate or not rotate correctly."
Remedy;1. Are FAN MAIN, FAN SUB2, and FAN LVPS rotating at power-on? Check the vent for exhausting internal air correctly. If the three fans are rotating and still this error occurs, replace MCU Board Assy. 2. Check if something is sticking on a fan and applying an extra load to the rotation. 3. Check the connection between FAN MAIN/FAN SUB2 <=> MCU Board Assy. Disconnection/slant connection of a connector Disconnection/damage of a harness. 4. Replace FAN MAIN. Replace FAN SUB2. 6. Replace FAN LVPS.
Code;E900
Description;"Memory failure
 An error occurs in reading/writing the nonvolatile memory on MCU Board Assy."
Remedy;"1. Any other electric appliances; generators, radiotransmitter, etc., within three meters from the printer? In such a case, noises from them may cause an error in reading/writing; therefore, change the location of them or turn them off. 2. MCU Board Assy itself has abnormality. Replace MCU Board Assy."
Code;E998
Description;"Engine communication error
 Communication between Main Board Assy and MCU Board Assy has abnormality."
Remedy;"1. Any other electric appliances; generators, radiotransmitter, etc., within three meters from the printer? In such a case, noises from them may cause an error in reading/writing; therefore, change the location of them or turn them off. 2. Connection between Main Board Assy and MCU Board Assy correct? 3. Replace Main Board Assy. 4. Replace MCU Board Assy."
