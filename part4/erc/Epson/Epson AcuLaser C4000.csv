Description;Compression SRAM initialization hardware error
Remedy;1 Initial setting: • Remove all the optional units and modules related to the electrical system and bring the printer back to the standard status. • Check if all connectors are properly connected to the CONTROLLER PWB. Replace or reinstall the relevant part. Go to step 2. 2 Checking the SD-RAM: • Remove all SD-RAMs from the RAM slots and then reinsert them in the RAM slots. Be sure to insert the SD-RAMs one by one (S0 and S1) in order so that the SD-RAM error can be identified. Every time you insert an SD-RAM, follow the procedures below and repeat it for each one. 1. Turn the power off. 2. Add the SD-RAM. 3. Turn the power on. • Insert the SD-RAM in the socket until it is locked securely. NOTE: Since the SD-RAM has the right direction to insert, be sure to insert it in the correct direction. Replace or reinstall the relevant part. Go to step 3. 3 Replacing the IC concerned: • Replace IC601 (VIP2: E05B93BA). • Replace IC600 (PWM). In cases other than above, replace the CONTROLLER PWB. Replace or reinstall the relevant part. Problem solved.
