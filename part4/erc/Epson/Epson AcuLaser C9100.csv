P674-8 J549A-4 . P674-9 J549A-3 . P674-10 J549A-2 . P674-11 J549A-1 . P674-12 Do all of the wiring have continuity? To Step 6 Replace the HARNESS ASSY 3TM 6 Installation check of TRAY LEVEL SENSOR Check the installation of the TRAY LEVEL SENSOR. Is the TRAY LEVEL SENSOR installed correctly? To Step 7 Remove and reinstall the TRAY LEVEL SENSOR. 7 Continuity check of HARNESS ASSY SNR 1. Disconnect the relay connector P674/J617 of the HARNESS ASSY SNR. 2. Disconnect the J108 of the TRAY LEVEL SENSOR. 3. Check if the following wiring have continuity. J617-12 . J108-1 J617-11 . J108-2 J617-10 . J108-3 Do all of the wiring have continuity? To Step 8 Replace the HARNESS ASSY SNR 8 Continuity check of HARNESS ASSY 3TM 1. Disconnect the J549A of the PWB ASSY 3TM. 2. Disconnect the relay connector P674/J617 of the HARNESS ASSY 3TM. 3. Check if the following wiring have continuity. J549A-12 . P674-1 J549A-11 . P674-2 J549A-10 . P674-3 Do all of the wiring have continuity? To Step 9 Replace the HARNESS ASSY 3TM 9 Check of TRAY LEVEL SENSOR 1. Replace the TRAY LEVEL SENSOR. 2. Turn the main power on. Does the error occur? Replace the PWB ASSY 3TM Problem solved
Code;E998
Description;Engine communication error - A communication error between the controller and the MCU PWB via the Video I/F occurred.
Causes;• FLAT CABLE ESS-MCU • BOARD ASSY, MAIN
Remedy;1 Check of Controller 1. Power on or power off the main power several times. Does the error occur? To Step 2 Problem solved 2 Continuity check of FLAT CABLE ESSMCU 1. Disconnect the P/J14 of the MCU PWB. 2. Disconnect the CN600 of the BOARD ASSY, MAIN. 3. Check each wiring for continuity. Do all of the wiring have continuity? Replace the BOARD ASSY, MAIN Replace the FLAT CABLE ESS-MCU
