If the paper is rolled in the Fuser Roller: • This occurs when a Guide claw is broken away or transformed. • It occurs when the Spring of a Guide claw is broken away or transformed. • It occurs when the Heat-Roller or Pressure-Roller is seriously contaminated with the toner. 3. Paper is accordion in the fuser.
Remedy;1. Check if the exit sensor actuator is defective. • Check if the actuator exit is unformed (Check if the lever part is unformed in shape). • Check whether burrs occur in the assembly part of the actuator exit or not and if the actuator is smoothly operated. • Check if foreign matters and wire get caught in the actuator exit`s operation. 2. If the paper is stuck in the fuser : disassemble the fuser and remove the jammed paper, and clean the surface of the pressure roller with dry gauze. 3. Remove the jammed paper after disassembling the fuser : Clean the surface of the pressure roller with dry gauze. • Remove the toner particles stained on the rib. • Check the assemblage and performance of the exit.

Code;18
Display;The printer is not working (1)
Description;While Power turned on, the printer is not working in the printing mode.
Causes;1. Run Self-Test Mode : Turn the power on and pressing “System Data List” by pressing Menu-Reports-System Data. 2. Check if the PC and the printer is properly connected and the toner cartridge installed. 3. Printing is not working in the Windows. 4. Check if the printer cable is directly connected to peripheral devices
Remedy;1.Check the power of the printer and perform the Self- Test. If the test printing works, that means no problems in the printer itself. If the test printing does not work, that means bad functioning of the printer(not because of software). 2. Replace the printer cable. If the problems not solved even after the cable replaced, check the amount of the remaining toner. 3. Check if the connection between PC and printer port is proper. If you use windows, check if the printer driver in the controller is set up. If the printer driver is properly set up, check in which program the printing is not working. The best way to find out is to open the memo pad to check the function of printing. If it is not working in a certain program, adjust the setup the program requires. Sometimes, the printout is normal within the Windows basic programs, but it`s not working in a particular program. In such case, install the new driver again. If not working in the Windows basic program, Check the setup of the port of CMOS is on ECP. And check the address of IRQ 7 and 378 4. If the scanner needs to be connected to the printer, first the remove the scanner from the PC to see if the printer is properly working alone.
Code;19
Display;The printer is not working (2)
Description;After receiving the printing order, no response at all or the low speed of printing occurs due to wrong setup of the environment rather than malfunction of the printer itself.
Causes;1. Secure more space of the hard disk. 2. Printing error occurs even if there is enough space in the hard disk. 3. Check the parallel-port-related items in the CMOS Setup. 4. Reboot the system to print.
Remedy;1. Not working with the message `insufficient printer memory` means hard disk space problem rather than the RAM problem. In this case, provide more space for the hard disk. Secure more space using the disk utilities program. 2. The connection of the cable and printer port is not proper. Check if the connection is properly done and if the parallel port in CMOS is rightly set up. 3. As a printer port, Select ECP or SPP among SPP(Normal), ECP, and EPP modes(increase printing speed) SPP normal mode support 8-bit data transfer, while ECP Mode transfer the 12-bit data. 4. If the regular font is not printing, the cable or the printer driver may be defective. Turn the PC and printer off, and reboot the system to print again. If not solved, double-click the printer in my computer If the regular fonts are not printed this time again. the cable must be defective so replace the cable with new one.
Code;20
Display;Abnormal Printing
Description;The printing is not working properly even when the cable has no problem. (even after the cable is replaced) If the printer won`t work at all or the strange fonts are repeated, the printer driver may be defective or wrong setup in the CMOS Setup.
Causes;1. Set up the parallel port in the CMOS SETUP. 2. Printer Driver Error. 3. Error message from insufficient memory. (The printing job sometimes stops or due to insufficient virtual memory, but it actually comes from the insufficient space of the hard disk.)
Remedy;1. Select SPP(Normal) or ECP LPT Port the among ECP, EPP or SPP in the CMOS Setup. 2. Check the printer in My Computer.(to see if the printer driver is compatible to the present driver or delete the old driver, if defective and reinstall the new driver) 3. Delete the unnecessary files to secure enough space of the hard disk and start printing job again.
Code;21
Display;SPOOL Error
Description;"To spool which stands for ""simultaneous peripheral operations online"" a computer document or task list (or ""job"") is to read it in and store it, usually on a hard disk or larger storage medium so that it can be printed or otherwise processed at a more convenient time (for example, when a printer is finished printing its current document)."
Causes;1. Insufficient space of the hard disk in the directory assigned for the basic spool. 2. If the previous printing error not solved. 3. When expected to collide with other program. 4. When an application program or the printer driver is damaged. 5. When some files related to OS are damaged or virus infected
Remedy;1. Delete the unnecessary files to provide more space to start printing job. 2. If there are some files with the extension name of ****.jnl, Delete them and Reboot the Windows to restart printing job. 3. Shut down all other programs except the current one, if possible. 4. Delete the printer driver completely and reinstall it. 5 After rebooting the computer, check for viruses, restore the damaged files and reinstall the program to do the printing job.

( Charge roller : 37.7 mm interval OPC drum : 75.5 mm interval) 2. If faded areas or voids occur in a black image at intervals of 75.5 mm, or black spots occur elsewhere, the OPC drum surface is damaged. 3. If a black image is partially broken, the transfer voltage is abnormal or the transfer roller`s life has expired.
Remedy;1. Run OPC cleaning Mode Print and run the Self-test 2 or 3 times. 2. In case of 75.5 mm interval unremovable in 1, cleanly remove foreign substances stuck on the OPC location equivalent to black spots and white spots with a dry duster. 3. The transfer roller guarantees 50.000 sheets printing. If the roller`s life is expired, replace it. 4. In case of 37.7 mm interval unremovable in 1, take measures as to replace the developer cartridge and try to print out. 5. Clean the inside of the set against the paper particles and foreign matter in order not to cause the trouble.
Code;26
Display;Light Image
Description;The printed image is light, with no ghost.
