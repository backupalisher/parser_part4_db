Code;01
Description;Vertical black line and band
Causes;1. Bad blade of Toner cartridge 2. LSU
Remedy;1. Change Toner cartridge 2. Replace LSU
Code;02
Description;Vertical white line
Causes;1. LSU window contamination 2. Toner cartridge
Remedy;1. Clean LSU window 2. If not LSU, change Toner cartridge
Code;03
Description;No image
Causes;1. Seal tape is removed? 2. GND OPC is well grounded? 3. LSU running well? 4. Biss voltage is normal? 5. Lower toner?
Remedy;1. Removing seal tipe 2. Measure the resistance between frame ground and the ground spring attached frame. Confirm stable ground. Unless bad ground, detach cabinet, check where is bad point 3.Adjust LSU or replace it 4. Normal Dev bias = -300V 5. Shake toner cartridge and print.If a liitke good, toner is empty
Code;04
Description;Light image
Causes;1. Check seal tape removing 2. LSU light power normal? 3. Enough toner? 4. High charger voltage? 5. Lower bias voltage 6. Contamination of high voltage contact 7. Transfer volatge and roller
Remedy;1. Check and remove tape 2. LSU light power check is difficult. Compare with new one and check. 3. Check toner and developer counter 4-5. Measure all high voltage output 6. Leakage toner cause bad contact and increase contact resistance. Clean contaminated area.
Code;05
Description;Dark image
Causes;1. LSU light power normal? 2. Bias voltage output is high? 3. Video data is always supplied?
Remedy;1. Check the rated level and replace 2. Set to power rating 3. Replace defected board
Code;06
Description;Background
Causes;1. High voltage output is normal? 2. C/R of Toner cartridge is contaminated?
Remedy;1. Adjust to the rated status 2. Replace Toner cartridge
Code;07
Description;Ghost
Causes;1. High voltage output 2. Bad high voltage contact
Remedy;1. Check every high voltage 2. Clean the inside machine or replace toner cartridge
Code;08
Description;Stains on back of paper
Causes;1. Contamination of transfer roller 2. Stains of paper path 3. Pressure roller’s contamination
Remedy;1. Clean the transfer roller with vaccum cleaner 2. Clean the area of paper path with cloth or air cleaner. 3. Remove fuser and replace it
Code;09
Description;Poor Fusing
Causes;1. Use recommended paper? 2. Check fusing temperature 3. The machine was under the low temperature for a long time?
Remedy;1. Should use recommended paper 2. Check engine board. If you have not thermometer, measure the thermistor voltage to CPU, If 2.98V+/-5% in printing CPU works well. Then, disassemble fuser and check the thermistor contact and thermistor. 3. Re-check after putting the machine in the warm place for certain period.
Code;10
Description;Partial blank image (not periodic)
Causes;1. Toner is low? 2. The toner cartridge is out of position?
Remedy;1. Replace Toner cartridge 2. Checkand adjust
Code;11
Description;Partial blank image (periodic)
Causes;1. Develope roller scar or particle 2. Scar or particle (94 mm) 3. Transfer roller scar or particle (47 mm)
Remedy;1-2. Replace toner cartridge 3. Replace transfer roller
Code;12
Description;Different image density (left and right)
Causes;1. Charge roller’s pressure force unbalance 2. Dev. roller and OPC or Dev. roller and blade’s pressure force unbalance 3. Transfer roller’s pressure force unbalance of each side
Remedy;1-2. Change toner cartridge 3. Check left and right spring of transfer roller and the spring pressing the developer inside the machine
Code;13
Description;Horizonral band
Causes;1. Unstable high voltage contact 2. Charge roller’s contamination 3. Contamination of heat roller 4. Malfunction of LSU
Remedy;1. Clean each contact and check good contact 2. Clean charge roller 3. Replace fuser unit 4. Check engine B’d
