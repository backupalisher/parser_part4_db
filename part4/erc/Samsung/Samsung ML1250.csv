Code;04
Display;JAM 2
Description;1. Recording paper is jammed in front of or inside the fuser. 2. Recording paper is stuck in the discharge roller and in the fuser just after passing through the Actuator-Feed.
Causes;1. If the paper is completely fed out of the printer, but Jam 2 occurs : Exit sensor is defective. • After the paper is completely discharged, actuator Exit should return to the original position to shut the photo-sensor. Sometimes it takes longer hour than it should and does not return. 2. If the paper is rolled in the Fuser Roller: • This occurs when a Guide claw is broken away or transformed. • It occurs when the Spring of a Guide claw is broken away or transformed. • It occurs when the Heat-Roller or Pressure-Roller is seriously contaminated with the toner. 3. Paper is accordion in the fuser.
Remedy;1. Check if the exit sensor actuator is defective. • Check if the actuator exit is unformed (Check if the lever part is unformed in shape). • Check whether burrs occur in the assembly part of the actuator exit or not and if the actuator is smoothly operated. • Check if foreign matters and wire get caught in the actuator exit`s operation. 2. If the paper is stuck in the fuser : disassemble the fuser and remove the jammed paper, and clean the surface of the pressure roller with dry gauze. 3. Remove the jammed paper after disassembling the fuser : Clean the surface of the pressure roller with dry gauze. • Remove the toner particles stained on the rib. • Check the assemblage and performance of the exit.

Remedy;1. Disassemble the fuser, clean the area between the Heat-roller and Thermistor and remove the foreign matter of the pressure roller. 2. If background appears badly in the printing, fix it by referring to the solutions for background.
Code;07
Display;OPC
Description;Paper is rolled up in the OPC.
Causes;1. Paper is too much thin. 2. The face of paper is curled.
Remedy;1. Recommend to use normal paper. 2. How to remove the rolled paper in the OPC. • Remove the paper while turning the OPC against the ongoing direction. • Clean fingerprints on the OPC softly with soft cloth dampened with IPA(Isopropyl Alcohol) or tissue.
Code;08
Display;All LEDs blinking (Fuser Error)
Description;1. All the lamps on the operator panel blink. 2. Gear of the fuser does not work and breaks away melt away. When printing, motor breaks away from its place due to defective fuser gear.
Causes;1. Check if the thermostat, AC wire and Heat Lamp is open. 2. Check if the thermistor sensor is in place. 3. Check if the heat lamp works properly. 4. Check if the overheat circuit works properly. 5. The fuser gear is defective due to melting away.
Remedy;1. If the thermostat is open replace the fuser and check following items. 2. If the thermistor sensor device is located deep in the sponge, replace the fuser. 3. Check if the circuit of overheat mode works properly. 4. Run DCU mode : Perform DCU diagnostic code 10.
