Code;35
Description;The Printer is Not Working (1) While the power is turned on, the printer is not working at all by the PRINT command from the computer.
Causes;1. Perform the Printer Self-Test. 2. Check if the PC and the printer cable are properly connected. 3. Check if the printer driver is correctly installed.
Remedy;1. Check the power source of the printer first and perform the Printer Self-Test. If the test results in printing, it is considered as there is no problem in the printer itself. If the printer is not working, the function may be defective (not due to S/W), so take another proper measure. 2. Check the status of the printer connection, and if it is defective, replace the printer cable (USB or Parallel). 3. Check the connection between PC and printer port (USB port or LPT port). Check if the printer driver at the Printers on the Control Panel is installed. If the printer driver is properly setup, check in which program the printing is not working. The best way is to try printing from the Memo pad, the WINDOWS basic program. Sometimes, the print out is normal within the WINDOWS basic programs, but it may not work in a specific program. In such case, reinstall the printer driver.
Code;36
Description;The Printer is Not Working (2) Even after the Print command, there is no response at all or the printing speed is low.
Causes;It may due to wrong setup of the environment rather than malfunction of the printer itself. And in case that abnormal characters are printed out, also check the environment setup. 1. Secure the hard disk space. 2. Printing error occurs even if there is enough space in the hard disk. 3. Reboot the system, and try printing again.
Remedy;1. Not working with the message `Insufficient memory` means that the hard disk space to store the print information is insufficient rather than the RAM insufficiency. In this case, secure more space for the hard disk. Secure more space for C drive by using the Disk utilities program at `PROGRAM - ACCESSORIES - SYSTEM TOOL` from the Start menu. 2. The connection of the cable or printer port is not properly setup. 3. If characters are printed abnormally, the cable or the printer driver may be defective. Turn the PC and printer off, and reboot the system to try printing again. If the problem still exists, double click to install the printer from My Computer and right-click the mouse, then click `Test Print` button at the bottom of the file information tab. If normal characters are not printed again, the cable must be defective so replace the cable with a new one.
Code;37
Description;Abnormal Printing The printing is not working properly even when the cable has no problem. (even after the cable is replaced) If the printer won`t work at all or strange characters are only printed, it may be the printer driver problem.
Causes;1. Printer driver error 2. Error due to insufficient memory. (The printing job sometimes stops during proceeding or not completed due to insufficient memory.)
Remedy;1. Check `My Computer - Printers`. (If the printer driver is installed not compatible with the printer currently installed or an error occurs in the driver file, remove the existing driver and reinstall the printer driver by using the `Printer Add` menu. 2. This is because of an insufficient virtual memory. (It does not mean the actual capacity of RAM but the space of hard disk.) Delete unnecessary files to secure enough space of the hard disk and try printing again.
Code;38
Description;Spool Error and Release of Spool Error pool (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations Online) refers to process the document to be read and stored in the hard disk or the mass storage media, and then to be printed at more convenient time. While the printer is outputting other file, the file requested to output is undergone to be spooled in the hard disk, the spool error may occur if a problem occurs in this process. First, delete the Spool Data if the Spool Error occurs.
Causes;I. Insufficient space of the hard disk set as the default spool directory. 2. If the previous printing out error is not solved. 3. In case a collision with other program is expected. 4. When an application program or the printer driver file is damaged. 5. If some of OS related files are damaged or malfunctioning due to virus infections. 6. The memory is less than that recommended by the OS
Remedy;1. Delete unnecessary files to provide more hard disk space and try printing job. 2. Since there may be some journal files with the extension ***.jnl, delete them and reboot the WINDOWS to restart printing job. 3. Exit all other programs except the program currently using, if possible, and print again. 4. Delete the printer driver completely and reinstall it. 5. After rebooting the computer, check viruses, restore the damaged files and reinstall the program, then try print ing again. 6. Add memory to the PC.
