Code;SC863-02 ... SC863-23
Description;HDD data read failure The data written to the HDD cannot be read normally.
Causes;"Bad sectors were generated during operation. (An error occurred in partition ""a"" (SC863-02) to partition ""v"" (SC863-23))."
Remedy;Guide for when to replace the HDD 1. When SC863 has occurred ten times or more • The interval is short. • Repeatedly occurs in the same situation (At power-on, etc.). • Startup takes a long time when the main power is turned on. 2. It takes a long time after main power on for the operation panel to become ready. HDD access may be consuming time. Normal HDD access time after main power on is about 5 seconds. If the machine is not waiting for the engine to be ready and it still takes 20 to 30 seconds or more, the HDD may be the cause. If there is a problem with the HDD, HDD-related SCs such as SC860 and SC863 will occur frequently. Print the SC log data and check them.
