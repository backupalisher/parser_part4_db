Code;SC541
Description;Fusing Unit Thermistor Error (Fatal Error)
Causes;No temperature was detected within 5 sec. after the machine was turned on (temperature was less than 0°C).
Remedy;"• Fusing unit thermistor disconnected, broken or not set correctly • Fusing lamp disconnected, broken or not set correctly. • Fusing unit defective • After servicing the machine to solve the problem, the service technician must execute a ""Fuser SC Reset"". Otherwise, the machine will continue to issue this SC code and cannot be operated."
Code;SC542
Description;Fusing Reload Temperature Error (Fatal Error)
Causes;After starting up or during operation he machine detected after 5 readings at 1.5 sec. intervals that the hot roller was 5°C below the reload (operating) temperature.
Remedy;"• Fusing thermistor deformed or out of position • Fusing lamp harness loose, broken, defective • Fusing unit defective • After servicing the machine to solve the problem, the service technician must execute a ""Fuser SC Reset"". Otherwise, the machine will continue to issue this SC code and cannot be operated."
Code;SC543
Description;High Temperature Error - Software (Fatal Error)
Causes;The temperature inside the fusing unit exceeded 225°C (437°F) for more than 1 sec.
Remedy;"• After this error has occurred three times, the machine will shut down and must be released with the Smart Organizing Monitor and serviced by a service technician. • Main board defective • PSU defective (TRIAC short) • After servicing the machine to solve the problem, the service technician must execute a ""Fuser SC Reset"". Otherwise, the machine will continue to issue this SC code and cannot be operated."
Code;SC544
Description;High Temperature Error- Hardware (Fatal Error)
Causes;The machine detected the CPU port LOW twice at 100 ms intervals and issued this SC. This check is always done to check for overheating, even if SC543 does not detect the problem.
Remedy;"• Fusing unit defective • Main board defective • PSU defective (TRIAC short) • After servicing the machine to solve the problem, the service technician must execute a ""Fuser SC Reset"". Otherwise, the machine will continue to issue this SC code and cannot be operated"
Code;SC545
Description;Fusing Lamp Remains ON Error (Fatal Error)
Causes;The heating element of the fusing lamp remained at full power longer than 9 sec. after the reload temperature was detected.
Remedy;"• Fusing thermistor harness connector loose, broken, defective • Fusing thermistor warped or positioned incorrectly • Fusing lamp harness connector loose, broken, defective • After servicing the machine to solve the problem, the service technician must execute a ""Fuser SC Reset"". Otherwise, the machine will continue to issue this SC code and cannot be operated"
Code;SC559
Description;Fusing Unit Third Jam Error (Fatal Error)
Causes;The exit sensor failed to detect the leading edge of the paper within the prescribed time and triggered a jam alert.
Remedy;"• After this error has occurred three times, the machine will shut down automatically and cannot be re-started until the machine has been serviced by a service technician. • Check the paper transport path for any physical obstructions (paper scraps, etc.) • Make sure the fusing unit has been installed correctly • After servicing the machine to solve the problem, the service technician must execute a ""Fuser SC Reset"". Otherwise, the machine will continue to issue this SC code and cannot be operated"
