Causes;• Paper overload • Paper set incorrectly • Upper limit sensor error/connector missing • Lower limit sensor error/connector missing • Harness broken • Bank control board defective • Foreign object, such as paper scrap, is caught inside the tray
Remedy;Remove the jammed paper or slip of paper from the tray, and check if the SC occurs by turning the main power OFF then ON. If the SC occurs again, do the following steps. Check if the SC reoccurs by cycling the power after each step. 1. Check if all connectors in the side LCIT are connected securely. Reconnect the connectors if they are disconnected, or loose. 2. Check the harness in the side LCIT. Replace the harnesses if it is disconnected, or damaged. 3. Check if the motor runs, sensors turn OFF/ON, has no overloads, and is properly driven.
