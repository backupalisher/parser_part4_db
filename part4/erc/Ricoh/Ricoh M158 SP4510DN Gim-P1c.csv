Note, however, that this may delete stored data such as documents remaining in the Fax transmission queue and those waiting for capture. Therefore, you must obtain the consent of your customer before executing the initialization. Note that after executing commands including Plumeria/Palm2, the job history will also be cleared. 3) If the error persists even after taking the above step, initialize all of the partitions in the HDD in accordance with SP5-832-001, then turn the main power off and then on again. Note, however, that this step will clear all of the data stored on the HDD including various documents, address book data, and so on. Therefore, again you must obtain the prior consent of your customers. Note that saved received Fax documents will be protected, but the receiving order may not be maintained. 4) If the error still cannot be restored, replace the HDD.
