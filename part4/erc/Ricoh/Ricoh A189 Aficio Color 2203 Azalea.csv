Description;Inconsistent main counter and backup counter Type: 2 - Description - This SC is displayed when the difference between the main and backup counter values is more than ±5. - Detection Timing - When the power switch is turned on When the Counter key is pressed
Causes;• Main counter SP-Log: 7-402-9
Code;SC902
Description;SCU-SCSI communication error Type:1 - Description - This SC occurs when the power switch is turned on and neither the scanner IPU board nor main control board is recognized or when an initial error occurs in the SCSI driver. - Detection Timing - Always
Causes;• SCU • SCSI cable SP-Log: 7-402-6
Code;SC903
Description;Serial communication error Type: 1 - Description - This SC is displayed when a counter serial I/O error is detected on the optics fiber cable between the SCU and the main control board for a successive five times. - Detection Timing - Always
Causes;• SCU • Main control board • Fiber cable SP-Log: 7-402-6
Code;SC920
Description;SCU/RAM board abnormal Type: 2 - Description - The SCU executes the read/write test for the RAM board on the SCU and the read/write operation is not successfully done. This SC is not displayed just after the read/write test because the CPU enters the hold state. It is displayed after the power switch is turned off and on. - Detection Timing - When the power switch is turned on
Causes;• RAM board SP-Log: 7-402-9
Code;SC931
Description;Printer NV-RAM abnormal Type: 1 - Description - When the main control board detects that illegal NV-RAM data has been loaded from the SCU, it notifies the SCU of an anomaly. - Detection Timing - When the power switch is turned on
Causes;• RAM board (Battery) • Main control board SP-Log: 7-402-9
Code;SC990
Description;I/O control board 1 abnormal Type: 2 - Description - This SC is displayed when a serial/parallel I/O error is detected in the I/O control board 1 for a successive five times. - Detection Timing - Always
Causes;• I/O control board 1 • Corona unit setting error • Connector/harness • Main control board SP-Log: 7-402-9
Code;SC991
Description;I/O control board 2 abnormal Type: 2 - Description - This SC is displayed when a serial/parallel I/O error is detected in the I/O control board 2 for a successive five times. - Detection Timing - Always
Causes;• I/O control board 2 • Corona unit setting error • Connector/harness • Main control board SP-Log: 7-402-9
