When SC863 has occurred ten times or more • The interval is short. • Repeatedly occurs in the same situation (At power-on, etc.). • Startup takes a long time when the main power is turned on. 2. It takes a long time after main power on for the operation panel to become ready. HDD access may be consuming time. Normal HDD access time after main power on is about 5 seconds. If the machine is not waiting for the engine to be ready and it still takes 20 to 30 seconds or more, the HDD may be the cause. If there is a problem with the HDD, HDD-related Error Name/Error Condition/Major Cause/Solution SCs such as SC860 and SC863 will occur frequently. Print the SC log data and check them.

Causes;• HDD defective • Power loss while data was writing to HDD • Software bug
Remedy;Procedure 1 1. If the machine shows SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 to SC865) with SC 925, do the recovery procedures for SC860 to SC865. Procedure 2 1. If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), cycle the main power OFF/ON. 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5-832-11 (HDD Formatting - Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: • Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased • All captured documents will be erased • Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased • Documents on the document server, and scanned documents will not be erased. • The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5-832-11, do these steps: 4. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management> Batch Delete Transfer Documents. Do SP5-832-011, and power cycle the machine. Procedure 3 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution to the problem, do SP5-832-001 (HDD Formatting - All) 2. Cycle the power machine off/on. • SP5-832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code. Procedure 4 1. If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.
