Description;This SC is displayed when an error related to the Address Book is detected at startup or during operation.
Causes;• There is a bug in the software. • There is an inconsistency in the Address Book source location (machine/delivery server/LDAP server). • There is an inconsistency in the Address Book encryption setting or encryption key (NVRAM or HDD was replaced individually without formatting the Address Book). • The device storing the Address Book (SD or HDD) was temporarily removed, or the hardware configuration does not match the application configuration. • The Address Book data is corrupted.
Remedy;Install the Address Book storage device properly. Turn OFF then ON the main power. If the SC recurs, perform the following steps. 1. After installing the HDD or SD/USB Flash ROM, execute SP5-846-046. 2. Wait more than 3 secs, and then execute SP5-832-006. 3. Turn OFF then ON the main power. • After SC870 is resolved, if there is backup data in the SD card or Web Image Monitor, restore the Address Book data. (To restore from the SD card, enter the same encryption password as the one entered when backing up the data.)
Code;SC871-01
Description;FCU Error The FCS detects an FCU error.

Code;SC876-00
Description;Log Data Error An error was detected in the handling of the log data at power ON or during machine operation.
Causes;• The log data file is corrupted (for example, power was cut off during machine operation). • The log encryption key is invalid (SC876-3). (Log encryption is enabled, but the NVRAM is corrupted, or only the NVRAM is replaced, or only the HDD is replaced, or the HDD is formatted.) • A mismatch with the HDD occurred because only the NVRAM was replaced (SC876-5). • A mismatch with the NVRAM occurred because only the HDD was replaced (SC876-5). • There is a bug in the software.
Remedy;1. Remove the HDD and turn ON the main power. 2. Initialize the LCS memory (SP5-801-019). 3. Turn OFF the main power. 4. Install the HDD and turn ON the main power. 5. Execute SP5-832-004. 6. Turn OFF the main power. The SC should be solved at this point. Steps 7 to 9 are for re-configuring the logging/encryption settings. 7. Turn ON the main power. 8. Set SP9-730-002, SP9-730-003, and SP9-730-004 to “1” (On). 9. Turn OFF then ON the main power.

Causes;• The HDD is defective. • Power was cut when writing onto the HDD. • There is a bug in the software.
Remedy;If SC860 to SC865 also happened at the same time, there is a problem with the HDD. Follow the troubleshooting procedures for SC860 to SC865. If SC860 to SC865 is not detected, perform the following steps: • Turn OFF then ON the main power. • If the problem is not solved, initialize the Net File partition on the HDD using SP5-832-11. However, because stored faxes will be erased, permission must be obtained from the customer. 1. From the file delivery settings screen on the UP, print all received faxes before deleting them. 2. From the Manage: Delete All DocumentsWaiting to be Sent screen on the UP, delete all the captured documents. 3. Execute SP5-832-011. 4. Turn OFF then ON the main power. If the problem is not solved after executing SP5-832-011, initialize the HDD partition using SP5-832-001, and then turn OFF then ON the main power. However, because all data in the HDD, such as documents and Address Book, will be lost, permission must be obtained from the customer. (Stored incoming faxes will not be deleted, but the order in which they are received may be changed.) If the problem is still not solved, replace the HDD.
