Causes;• HDD defective • Power supply to machine cut occurred while writing data to HDD • Software error Recovery Procedure 1 If the machine returns SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 ~ SC865), please follow the recovery procedures described for these SC codes. Recovery Procedure 2 If the machine does not return one of the five HDD errors (SC860 ~ SC865), turn the machine off and on. If this does not solve the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5832 011 (HDD Formatting – Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: Jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder Before initializing the NetFile partition on the HDD please inform the client that: 1. Received faxes on the delivery server will be lost 2. All captured documents will be lost 3. DeskTopBinder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be cleared 4. Documents stored on the document server will not be lost. 5. The first time the network accesses the machine, the management information must be reconfigured (this will require a significant amount of time). 6. Execute SP5832 011 then turn the machine off and on. Recovery Procedure 3 If “Procedure 2” does not solve the problem, execute SP5832 001 (HDD Formatting – All), then turn the machine off and on. Executing SP5832 001 erases all document and address book data stored on the hard disks. Be sure to consult with the customer before executing this SP code. Recovery Procedure 4 If “Recovery Procedures 1 to 3” fail to correct the problem, replace the HDD.
