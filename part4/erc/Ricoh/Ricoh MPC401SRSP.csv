Remedy;
Code;925
Description;Net File function error. The NetFile file management on the HDD cannot be used, or a NetFile management file is corrupted and operation cannot continue. The HDDs are defective and they cannot be debugged or partitioned, so the Scan Router functions (delivery of received faxes, document capture, etc.), Web services, and other network functions cannot be used.
Causes;• HDD defective • Power loss while data was writing to HDD • Software bug
Remedy;Procedure 1 If the machine shows SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 to SC865) with SC 925, do the recovery procedures for SC860 to SC865. Procedure 2 1. If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), turn the machine power off and on. 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5832-11 (HDD Formatting – Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: • Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased • All captured documents will be erased • Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased • Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. • The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5832-11, do these steps: 4. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management> Batch Delete Transfer Documents. 5. Do SP5832-11, and turn the machine off and on. Procedure 3 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution for the problem, do SP5832-1 (HDD Formatting – All) 2. Cycle the machine off/on. • SP5832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code. Procedure 4 If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.
Code;990-00
Description;Software error 1
Causes;An unexpected operation was encountered by the software.
Remedy;• Software crash, reboot the machine • If the HDDs have just been replaced, be sure to download the stamp data (SP 5853). • With SP5990 004(SMC Report – Logging Data), print the most recent information for SC990. • The SC990 information displays the file name, line number, and value. Report this information to your technical supervisor. For example: Function.c LINE: 123 VAL: 0
Code;991-00
Description;Software continuity error CTL The software has attempted to perform an unexpected operation. However, unlike SC 990, the object of the error is continuity of the software. The software performed an unexpected function and the program cannot continue. Recovery processing allows the program to continue.
Causes;• Abnormal variable • Internal parameter error • Insufficient work memory • Hardware error not detected by SC
Remedy;1. Execute SP7403 or print an SMC Report (SP5990) to read the history of the 10 most recent logged errors. 2. If you press the zero key on the operation panel with the SP selection menu displayed, you will see detailed information about the recently logged SC991, including the software file name, line number, and so on. Of these two methods, 1) is the recommended method, because another SC could write over the information for the previous SC.
Code;992-00
Description;Undefined error (no SC code)
Causes;An error not controlled by the system occurred (the error does not come under any other SC code). Software defective
Remedy;• Re-install firmware

Remedy;• Check the devices necessary for the application program. If necessary devices have not been installed, install them. • Check that application programs are correctly configured. • For a fax operation problem, simplify the nesting of the fax group addresses. • Take necessary countermeasures specific to the application program. If the logs can be displayed on the operation panel, see the logs.
Code;998-00
Description;Application start error CTL No applications start within 60 seconds after the power is turned on.
