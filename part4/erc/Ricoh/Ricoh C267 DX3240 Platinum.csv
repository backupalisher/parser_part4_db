Code;E-04
Description;Thermal Head Overheat Temperature of the thermal head is greater than 65Â°C when the Start key is pressed.
Causes;Overheat (wait for the thermal head to cool down) Thermal head
Code;E-06
Description;Main Motor Lock The CPU cannot detect the master eject position sensor (drum HP) signal within 5.0 seconds after the main motor turns on.
Causes;Main motor drive Main motor Motor drive board Master eject position sensor
Code;E-09
Description;Thermal Head Thermistor Open The thermistor output voltage is over 4.432 volts.
Causes;Thermal head thermistor Thermal head connector
Code;E-10
Description;Thermal Head Energy Pulse error The CPU detects an abnormal ID signal from the thermal head energy control pulse.
Causes;Thermal head connector Thermal head MPU
Code;E-12
Description;Pressure Plate error The pressure plate home position sensor does not turn on within 6 seconds during initialization. Both the pressure plate home position and pressure plate limit sensors turn on when the main SW is turned on. The pressure plate home position sensor does not turn off when the pressure plate limit sensor does not turn on within 4.5 seconds when compressing the ejected master.
Causes;Pressure plate drive Pressure plate motor Plate position sensors Master eject error
Code;E-13
Description;Scanner error The scanner HP sensor does not turn on after the scanner motor has moved for more than 10 seconds back to home position after scanning. The scanner cannot leave the home position within 2.0 seconds of power on. Just after switching the power on, the scanner cannot return to the home position within 2.0 seconds of leaving.
Causes;Scanner drive Scanner HP sensor Scanner motor Scanner wire has come off
Code;E-22
Description;2nd Feed Start Timing Sensor error The 2nd feed start timing sensor does not activate before the master eject position sensor activates.
Causes;Drum sensors Feeler
Code;E-23
Description;Master Eject Position Sensor (Drum HP) error The master eject position sensor does not activate before the feed start timing sensor activates.
Causes;Drum sensors Feeler
Code;E-24
Description;Feed Start Timing Sensor error The feed start timing sensor does not activate before the 2nd feed timing sensor activates.
Causes;Drum sensors Feeler
Code;E-40
Description;Thermal Head ID error The CPU detects an abnormal ID signal from the thermal head.
Causes;Different thermal head MPU Thermal head connector disconnected
Code;E-44
Description;MSU error
Causes;Replace the MPU
Code;E-50
