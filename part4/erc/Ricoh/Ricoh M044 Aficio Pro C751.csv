Description;Net File function error
Causes;The NetFile file management on the HDD cannot be used, or a NetFile management file is corrupted and operation cannot continue. The HDDs are defective and they cannot be debugged or partitioned, so the Scan Router functions (delivery of received faxes, document capture, etc.), Web services, and other network functions cannot be used. HDD status codes are displayed below the SC code:
Remedy;• Refer to the four procedures below (Recovery from SC 925). Recovery from SC 925 Procedure 1 If the machine shows SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 to SC865) with SC 925, do the recovery procedures for SC860 to SC865. Procedure 2 1. If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), turn the machine power off and on. 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5832-11 (HDD Formatting – Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: • Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased • All captured documents will be erased • Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased • Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. • The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5832-11, do these steps: 4. Go into the User Tools mode and do “Delivery Settings” to print all received fax documents that are scheduled for delivery. Then erase them. 5. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management> Batch Delete Transfer Documents. 6. Do SP5832-11, and turn the machine off and on. Procedure 3 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution for the problem, do SP5832-1 (HDD Formatting – All) 2. Cycle the machine off/on. • SP5832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code. Procedure 4 If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.
Code;SC990
Description;Software error 1

Report this information to your technical supervisor. For example: Function.c LINE: 123 VAL: 0
Code;SC991
Description;Software Error 2
Causes;The software peformed an unexpected function and the program cannot continue. Recovery processing allows the program to continue.
Remedy;• Software defective, re-boot In order to get more details about SC991: 1. Execute SP7403 or print an SMC Report (SP5990) to read the history of the 10 most recent logged errors. 2. If you press the zero key on the operation panel with the SP selection menu displayed, you will see detailed information about the recently logged SC991, including the software file name, line number, and so on. Of these two methods, 1) is the recommended method, because another SC could write over the information for the previous SC.
