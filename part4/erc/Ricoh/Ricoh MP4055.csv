Description;Continuously detecting malfunction The proximity sensor keeps in a detection state and accumulated time exceeds 24 hours.
Causes;The proximity sensor is disabled and is in the detection state at all times.
Remedy;1. Go to the SP5-102-203 (input check SP for the proximity sensor). 2. Cover the sensor with 10 sheets of plain paper, and then execute SP to confirm if it becomes “0”. (Do not place your hand near the sensor even over the papers when covering the sensor) 3. Remove the papers from the sensor and confirm if it becomes “1”. 4. If there is no issue after the confirmation in step 2 and 3, confirm that there are no possible factors around the machine that may cause the temperature change such as heater or fan. (Deal with the issue as necessary) 5. Replace the proximity sensors and proximity sensor board if the abnormal value is detected after the confirmation in step 2 and 3. 6.
