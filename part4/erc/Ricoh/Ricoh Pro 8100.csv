Causes;While EAC (External Application Converter), the conversion module, was operating normally, the receipt of a power line interrupt signal from the FLUTE serial driver was detected, or BREAK signal from the other station was detected.
Remedy;• Controller power outage • Controller rebooted • Connection to controller loose
Code;SC920-01 ... SC920-04
Description;SC920-01 B Printer Error 1 (No response at PM start) GW SC920-01 Printer Error 1 (Timeout occurred during PM operation) GW SC920-02 Printer Error 1 (WORK memory not acquired) GW SC920-03 Printer Error 1 (Filter processing did not start) GW SC920-04 Printer Error 1 (Filter processing ended abnormally) GW
Causes;An internal application error was detected and operation cannot continue.
Remedy;• Software defective, switch off/on, or change the controller firmware • Insufficient memory
Code;SC921-00
Description;Printer Error 2: Font error
Causes;When the printer application started, the specified font could not be found on the SD card.
Remedy;• The specified font is not on the SD card • SD card data corrupted
Code;SC925
Description;Net File function error. The NetFile file management on the HDD cannot be used, or a NetFile management file is corrupted and operation cannot continue. The HDDs are defective and they cannot be debugged or partitioned, so the Scan Router functions (delivery of received faxes, document capture, etc.), Web services, and other network functions cannot be used. HDD status codes are displayed below the SC code:
Causes;• HDD defective • Power loss while data was writing to HDD • Software bug
Remedy;Procedure 1 If the machine shows SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 to SC865) with SC 925, do the recovery procedures for SC860 to SC865. Procedure 2 1. If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), turn the machine power off and on. 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5832-11 (HDD Formatting – Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: • Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased • All captured documents will be erased • Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased • Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. • The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5832-11, do these steps: 4. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management> Batch Delete Transfer Documents. 5. Do SP5832-11, and turn the machine off and on. Procedure 3 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution for the problem, do SP5832-1 (HDD Formatting – All) 2. Cycle the machine off/on. • SP5832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code. Procedure 4 If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.
Code;SC990-00
Description;Software error 1
Causes;An unexpected operation was encountered by the software.
Remedy;• Software crash, reboot the machine • If the HDDs have just been replaced, be sure to download the stamp data (SP 5853). • With SP5990 004(SMC Report – Logging Data), print the most recent information for SC990. • The SC990 information displays the file name, line number, and value. Report this information to your technical supervisor. For example: Function.c LINE: 123 VAL: 0
Code;SC991-00
Description;Software Error 2
Causes;The software peformed an unexpected function and the program cannot continue. Recovery processing allows the program to continue.
Remedy;• Abnormal variable • Internal parameter error • Insufficient work memory • Hardware error not detected by SC In order to get more details about SC991: 1. Execute SP7403 or print an SMC Report (SP5990) to read the history of the 10 most recent logged errors. 2. If you press the zero key on the operation panel with the SP selection menu displayed, you will see detailed information about the recently logged SC991, including the software file name, line number, and so on. Of these two methods, 1) is the recommended method, because another SC could write over the information for the previous SC.
Code;SC992-00
Description;Undefined Error (No SC Code)
Causes;An error not controlled by the system occurred (the error does not come under any other SC code).
Remedy;• Software defective • Incorrect SC code from previous machine
Code;SC995
Description;CPM setting error
Causes;The 11-digit machine code information and the manufacturer code were compared.
Remedy;• The machine code and manufacturer codes do not match.
Code;SC997-00
Description;Application selection error 1
Causes;An application did not start after pressing the appropriate key on the operation panel.
Remedy;• Software bug
Code;SC998-00
Description;Application selection error 2
Causes;Register processing did not execute for an application within 60 sec. after the machine was switched on. No applications start correctly, and all end abnormally.
Remedy;• Software bug • A RAM or DIMM option required by the application is not installed or not installed correctly.
