Remedy;• Disconnected or defective motor harness. 1. Turn the machine`s main power off, and then on.
Code;541
Description;Fuser thermistor error
Causes;The thermistor output is less than 0°C for 5 seconds after the fusing lamp turns ON.
Remedy;"• Disconnected or defective thermistor • Disconnected or defective fusing lamp 1. Check the harness connection of the thermistor. 2. Replace the fusing unit. • Execute ""Fuser SC Reset"" to recover the machine after completing the recovery procedure. Otherwise, the machine continues to issue this SC code and cannot be operated."
Code;542
Description;Fuser reload error
Causes;"This SC is issued if one of following conditions occurs: The fusing temperature rises 8°C or less in 1.5 seconds; and this continues 5 times consecutively. -or- The fusing temperature has not reached 45°C within 9 seconds (after the fusing lamp comes ON while the machine is warming-up). -or- The fusing unit does not attain reload temperature within 35 s. (normal temperature) or 65 s (lower temperature – the thermistor output is less than 18°C) after the fusing temperature control starts."
Remedy;• Defective or deformed thermistor • Incorrect power supply input at the main power socket 1. Defective fusing lamp
Code;543
Description;High temperature error (Soft)
Causes;• The detected temperature stays at 235°C for 1 second, and this consecutively occurs 10 times.
Remedy;"• Defective Main board • Defective PSU 1. Replace the Main board 2. Replace the PSU • Execute ""Fuser SC Reset"" to recover the machine after completing the recovery procedure. Otherwise, the machine continues to issue this SC code and cannot be operated."
Code;544
Description;High temperature error (hard)
Causes;• During stand-by mode or a print job, the detected heating roller temperature reaches 250°C.
Remedy;"• Defective Main board • Defective PSU 1. Replace the Main board 2. Replace the PSU • Execute ""Fuser SC Reset"" to recover the machine after completing the recovery procedure. Otherwise, the machine continues to issue this SC code and cannot be operated."
Code;545
Description;Fuser full heater error
Causes;The fuser full heater remained ON at full capacity for more than 9 s after the fusing temperature attains reload temperature.
Remedy;"• Deformed thermistor • Thermistor not in the correct position • Defective fusing lamp 1. Replace the fusing unit. 2. Replace the fusing lamp. • Execute ""Fuser SC Reset"" to recover the machine after completing the recovery procedure. Otherwise, the machine continues to issue this SC code and cannot be operated."
Code;547
Description;Zero cross error
Causes;• The zero cross signal is detected three times even though the fusing lamp relay is off when turning on the main power. • The zero cross signal is not detected for 3 seconds even though the fusing lamp relay is on after turning on the main power or closing the front door. • The detection error occurs twice or more in 11 zero cross signal detections.
