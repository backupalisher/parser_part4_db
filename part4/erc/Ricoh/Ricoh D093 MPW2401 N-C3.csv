Remedy;Procedure 1 If the machine shows SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 to SC865) with SC 925, do the recovery procedures for SC860 to SC865. Procedure 2 1. If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), turn the machine power off and on. 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5832-11 (HDD Formatting – Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: • Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased • All captured documents will be erased • DeskTopBinder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased • Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. • The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5832-11, do these steps: 4. Go into the User Tools mode and do “Delivery Settings” to print all received fax documents that are scheduled for delivery. Then erase them. 5. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management> Batch Delete Transfer Documents. 6. Do SP5832-11, then turn the machine power off and on. Procedure 3 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution for the problem, do SP5832-1 (HDD Formatting – All) 2. Cycle the machine off/on. • SP5832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code. Procedure 4 If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.
