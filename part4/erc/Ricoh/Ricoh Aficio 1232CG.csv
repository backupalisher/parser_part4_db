Causes;• Software defective • An option required by the application (RAM, DIMM, board) is not installed.
Code;999
Description;"Program download error
 The download (program, print data, language data) from the IC card does not execute normally. Important Notes About SC999 • This SC is not logged, because it operates primarily in the download mode. • If the machine loses power while downloading, or if for some other reason the download does not end normally, this could damage the controller board or the PCB targeted for the download and prevent subsequent downloading. If this problem occurs, the damaged PCB must be replaced."
Causes;• Software defective • An option required by the application (RAM, DIMM, board) is not installed • Board installed incorrectly • BICU defective • Controller defective • IC card defective • NVRAM defective • Loss of power during downloading
