Code;SC925-00, SC925-01
Description;SC925- 00 NetFile function error SC925- 01 NetFile function error The NetFile file management on the HDD cannot be used, or a NetFile management file is corrupted and operation cannot continue. The HDDs are defective and they cannot be debugged or partitioned, so the Scan Router functions (delivery of received faxes, document capture, etc.), Web services, and other network functions cannot be used. HDD status codes are displayed below the SC code:
Causes;• HDD defective • Power loss while data was writing to HDD • Software bug
Remedy;See the table and the procedure below. Here is a list of HDD status codes: (-1) HDD not connected (-2) HDD not ready (-3) No label (-4) Partition type incorrect (-5) Error returned during label read or check (-6) Error returned during label read or check (-7) “filesystem” repair failed (-8) “filesystem” mount failed (-9) Drive does not answer command (-10) Internal kernel error (-11) Size of drive is too small (-12) Specified partition does not exist (-13) Device file does not exist Procedure 1 1. If the machine shows SC codes for HDD errors (SC860 to SC865) with SC 925, do the recovery procedures for SC860 to SC865. Procedure 2 1. If the machine does not show one of the five HDD errors (SC860 to SC865), cycle the main power OFF/ON. 2. If this is not the solution for the problem, then initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD with SP5-832-11 (HDD Formatting - Ridoc I/F). NetFiles: These are jobs printed from the document server using a PC and DeskTopBinder. Before you initialize the NetFile partition on the HDD, tell the customer: • Received faxes on the delivery server will be erased • All captured documents will be erased • Desk Top Binder/Print Job Manager/Desk Top Editor job history will be erased • Documents on the document server, and scanned documents, will not be erased. • The first time that the network gets access to the machine, the management information must be configured again (this will use a lot of time). 3. Before you initialize the Netfile partition with SP5-832-11, do these steps: 4. In the User Tools mode, do Document Management> Batch Delete Transfer Documents. Do SP5-832-11, and cycle the main power OFF/ON. Procedure 3 1. If “Procedure 2” is not the solution for the problem, do SP5-832-001 (HDD Formatting - All) 2. Cycle the machine off/on. • SP5-832-001 erases all document and address book data on the hard disks. Consult with the customer before you do this SP code. Procedure 4 1. If “Procedure 3” does not solve the problem, replace the HDD.
